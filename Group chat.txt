[6/3/21, 4:30:43 PM] Mom Airtel: *Stray bullets are real , pls note the following* 

1. If u have nothing doing outside pls stay indoors.

2. Do not stay too long at bus stops , take a timely  decision if u wanna take a cab.

3. This is not a good time to see people off by trekking long distances before getting a cab.

4. For those driving personal vehicles, the more u stay away from high traffic areas ,the better at this time.

5. When u hear news of unrest and violence from a particular area pls avoid such areas, do not be too eager to go see what is going on there .

6. Avoid staying close to windows of your office and homes.

7. Avoid late night movements , the earlier u return to your homes safely the better.

8. Ensure u keep in touch with family and friends on a daily basis via phone calls.

9.Continue to share valid information from different locations and also warn as many people as you possibly can to avoid hotspots.

10. It is not a bad idea to exhibit your human right by clamouring for good governance however, let's be guided on how we go about it ..

Wisdom is profitable to direct....

*Pls stay safe*

Just ask them to call you with the person's number. They might go as far as telling you that they are Road Safety Officers. Please don't be carried away by that.  It is another format the bad guys are operating with. You can be kidnapped, raped, robbed or killed in the process if you rush to meet them. Please pass this information till it gets to everyone you know because you may be saving lives as you share.

[6/16/21, 7:13:44 AM] DAD: I am perplexed...pls read 

It was a pool party with naked girls.

And they were there.

Men who have achieved.

Money, power and fame.

Men in their prime who tell time to hold still since they have refused to age and it grudgingly obeys in detente and in temporaneous.

They dress young, they dance young, they act young.

They are current on all fronts.

Most of them married with children but mentally and emotionally single.

At this party they threw in a high brow residence in an exclusive neighbourhood in Ikoyi there was an abundance of food, drinks, drugs and real youth.

The youth came exclusively from the girls that were in attendance.

Girls in their late teens and early twenties.

Well spoken and extensively travelled.

Daughters of the materially blessed.

Read this to help your children now. Their safety is your choice.All of them students.

All of them naked.

Some were in the swimming pool, some at the bar, some danced under the cabana, others were hobnobing with the swimming trunks clad men at various places in the specially lit pool area that stood under the starry night sky.

And I sat with one of them.

She was caramel smooth, finely contoured, delicately featured and doe like.

She was twenty going on twenty one.

And a sophomore at Babcock university.

To every question I asked, she took a drag from the reefer in her hand, blow out the smoke through her mouth and nostrils, took a sip from her glass of Hennessey and coke on ice before she responded.

Her voice was sweet.

And her smile was rapturous.

"I heard students need permission to leave your school. How could you get out this late and stay overnight?"

"We have our ways."

"We?"

"Yeah all of us."

"From Babcock?"

"Not all. Some from Covenant, Redeemers, Madonna, ABUAD, Pan African and stuff."

"No unilag or UI?"

"They ain't boujee."

"Boujee?"

"Yeah. They are crass. Men like you guys don't want to roll with local cats like those right?"

I looked at her silently as she took a drag from her reef.

The aroma assailed it. It was caustic yet not aggravating.

"What's that?"

"Comorado."

"What's that?"

She laughed.

"It's good stuff. Hits you slowly and then makes you soar like superman."

I looked around and saw the girls doing one thing or another in their nudity.

She was staring at me.

"Is this your first party?"

I nodded.

"No wonder you are asking all these hang questions."

"Why do you do this?"

"I'm young. I need to live life before it becomes too serious and I have to be all grown up."

"But why the drugs?"

"Because."

"Because what?"

"Because this is how we roll. Everyone has their poison. If you are not on reef, you do codeine or cocaine or heroin or speed or AZT or ecstasy or royfenol or fentanyl or meth or oxy or worst case you inhale glue and get your high."

I stared at her as she inhaled and exhaled languidly.

"Why the parties?"

"You get your hit for free here. You have fun. You make good money."

"But for you to attend those schools you must be rich."

"My parents are not me."

"But they give you money."

"They pay the tuition and all. Not like they can give me a million in cash."

"Do you get a million here?"

"Well two or three parties can make me that."

"Aren't you afraid of running into your Dad at places like this?"

"Naaaa... my dad is too square and busy but even if he is not then it is his problem after all he came here for what I came here for so he can't tell me nothing."

I fell silent and watched her inhale and exhale smoke.

"But you know, your folks put you in schools like that to protect you?"

"Too protect me?"

"Yes."

"They are too busy to even bother."

"No they are not."

"Yes they are. They think the school will be both my teachers and my parents."

"I think they are just worried about you getting corrupted."

"I was balling like this under their nose and they didn't even notice. Funny thing is that even the innocent Jane get influenced in school, so what was the use of all the headache of keeping us locked up in all these secondary schools that front as universities."

"They did it out of love and with the belief that those schools are way better than the public ones."

"Well they fucked up."

"Fucked up?"

"Is this an interview or what?"

"No I am just intrigued."

"And I am horny."

I fell silent.

She dragged, exhaled, took a drink from her glass, sucked on one of the ice cubes in her mouth and asked in a whisper.

"Are you going to do anything about it?"

-----------------------------

The best time to do core parenting is between ages 0-12. You simply cannot afford to be too busy at this stage. Schools, nannies, extra murals cannot replace core parenting at this point. If you are absent in your child's life at this stage, be sure someone else is shaping your child's worldview .

At 12 a child's curiosities are set. And they spend their teenage years exploring those curiosities and fantasies and experimenting with their identities.

If you attempt core parenting in teenage years, you will meet a brick wall and you might end up with a fractious relationship with your teen.

Your best mode as a parent of a teenager is to "befriend" them. At this stage you can't take anything for granted you will have to earn their trust. Seek to influence them not control at this point. They will resist control but will respond wonderfully to influence: yours or the streets.

Every Nigerian parents needs to read this. So share it and continue sharing it. Its very important.

Thanks for the information above.
I just checked the number on Truecaller Profile and it is registered as 'Killer Mtn'. This is very true.
Please verify on Truecaller if you have. I did & it shows "killer Mtn" and "forbidding number"  of a truth.

[7/7/21, 2:59:11 AM] ‪+234 803 410 3239‬: I noticed we had grass growing rapidly inside my new compound, so, my neighbour and I decided to get rid of them.

I asked around and found someone who would do it.

Brought him to the compound, showed him around, so he said he'd clear it for 3K, but we can also negotiate.

Inside me, I was surprised because the work too big for that amount.

So, I told him we would give him 5K instead. 

Mehn, the dude was overjoyed.

He ran off to get his working tools, got back and was almost starting off. 

I asked him to halt, and confirmed if he's had something to eat. 

He said -- No.

That he hasn't even eaten since the evening before.

I quickly prepared tea, bread and fried eggs for him.

Chai! Tears commot for the guy eye when I give am.

He finished eating, picked up his tools, and worked enthusiastically with all his heart.

At intervals, I'll stop what I was doing inside to check on him. Sometimes, chat and laugh with him. (Dude was a real jolly fellow eh, lol)

So, he rounded up for that day, and said he'd be coming around the next day to pack the dead grass.

I gave him the 5K.

He was really excited. I told him to take my contact so he could reach me before coming the next day, he said he would have loved to, but he doesn't have a phone

Said he sold it 2 weeks back, so he could eat. All he had left was his SIM.

I felt his pain, but I remembered I had an Itel phone I wasn't using, so I gave it to him+N500 for recharge card.

Tears just roll from the guy eye instantly.

And he said, one of the most deepest "God Bless You", I've ever gotten in my life.

So, he left excitedly.

And, for me -- I slept like a baby that night.

Dude came the next day, and continued the remaining task with so much passion. 

I could literally see it all over him. 

I shared from the rice I had left with him for breakfast, and by 12 noon, he was done with the whole task.

He thanked me endlessly, and left.

All these happened this weekend (Saturday, and yesterday--Sunday)

Now, I got a call very early today from him, and he gave me a great news. 

He said his former Oga that relocated from Ibadan to Abuja, reached him on phone, the same yesterday, immediately he inserted his SIM into the phone I gave him.

And that his Oga told him he's been trying hard to reach him for weeks to no avail. 

The Oga finally asked sent him  N100k this morning.

Chai! Me sef come happy pass the guy sef.😁

He ended the call with these words --

 "Senior man, if to say I no meet you, naso this one for take pass me oh".

Tears just drop my eye, aswear.

Why my long boring story?

Always do little things you can do, to change people's lives. It might be little to you, but that might be the answers to their long-standing heart desires. 

These bits of kindness must not come in monetary forms.

• You can tell people kind words.

• Give them a bit of your time

• Hear them out

• Give them warm hugs

• Never despise or look down on them

• Applaud them when they carry out duties for you

• Make them feel like the humans that they really are.

And, you might just be saving a life in the process.

[7/8/21, 9:07:21 AM] ‪+234 803 410 3239‬: Can we get the same fabrics in Lagos?
[7/8/21, 5:30:14 PM] Mom Airtel: I want you all to be mindful of your security. Listen to news regularly
The country is going very difficult and unsafe times. Presently there are calls from foreign concerns to declare Nigeria a failed state. This is because of the level of insecurity present in the country presently. 

We all need to be concerned about our safety. Do not say it can never happen to me. No one is safe. Relatives of the President had been kidnapped. Men of God, Security men etc. No one is safe nowhere is safe. Let us try and observe strict security protocols together with our prayers.

*ONE*
So I direct you all never to stay out of the house late.
Come back home latest 6pm
Do not attend church program beyond 6pm except it's a vigil. Whatever they're doing if they don't close by 6pm, please I advise you to leave and start coming back to your house.

*TWO*
Do not travel in marked vehicles. For example, vehicles bearing names ẹ.g. CAC, New Covenant Church, University, company etc. 

*THREE*
Do not travel in groups. If you are to go for a program, move alone.

*FOUR*
If your area is being attacked, switch of all lights including any switch with lights no matter how tiny. Remove all jewelry on your body and wrap your phone in a cloth to prevent light reflection that can betray your position. 
If you hear gunshot, leave your bed and lie flat under the bed and out of your window. Get out of sight. Lie close to any wall.

*FIVE*
Do not take ride in any vehicle that you don't know. Take public transportation at all times.

*SIX*
When you go out, dress normal and neat not flashy. Never wear any clothes that can get you noticed or identified. 

*SEVEN*
If you are going out to somewhere, tell someone where you are going to and the expected time of your arrival. If possible don't go alone.

*EIGHT*
On no account should you visit online friends. People who you meet on social media, you should never visit them either in public or in their home or office. NEVER.

*NINE*
Speak very little when you are in the public and never comment on government or political issues.

*TEN*
Always maintain call credit on your phone and always ensure you have power on it or buy power bank. You may need to make contact incase of ATTACK. 

*ELEVEN*
If under attack, do not make voice calls, because sound travel faster and quietly at night, just ring the number repeatedly if the person pick, don't speak. Just send text. When doing that do it under cover so that your phone will not reflect any ray of light.

*TWELVE*
Don't buy group dress from anyone for now. No matter how close they are to you , don't buy. 

*THIRTEEN*
Don't attend parties that you are not closely concerned.

*FOURTEEN*
If at all, you come under attack, remember there are only 2 rules to guide you. 
*1) DO NOT PANIC*
*2) NOT TO FORGET RULE 1* 
If you panic, you will attract attention of the attackers to yourselves, and you will not remember exactly what you need to do to keep you safe.

*FIFTEEN*
This is not the time to do fashion or to showcase your new clothing and shoes. Anytime you go out wear dress and especially shoes that will allow you to run incase you need to get out of troubled area fast. Wear cheap shoes that you can throw away if it impedes your movement. Your dress should not hinder your ability to run. 

*SIXTEEN*
Prepare for any eventuality. Do not say it can't happen. Be Prepared. Trouble can happen anywhere any time. Remember your life is very important to me, not your phone or your property. 

*SEVENTEEN*
If you have to run, throw away anything in your hand. Save yourself first. Don't wait to pick anything that drop from your hands. Run as fast as you can.

*EIGHTEEN*
If there is shooting, try the rules. Do not panic. The fact that you heard the gunshot means that you are not hit. If you are hit, you will not hear the SOUND. 
#. Reduce your height first by bending down as close to the ground as possible. 
#. Then try and identify the direction of the shots first then draw a cross putting the direction of the shot at north or south, run East or WEST. 
#. Never run straight line in opposite direction because bullets travel at straight line and never run toward the point of the gunshot. 
#. As you are moving out of the troubled area, identify hard objects or structures that you can use as protection where you can hide. 
#. If you notice the sound is coming closer, shift your location a little as you continue to run. If not, find a safe place and hide in sitting position to avoid stray bullets from hitting you. 

*NINETEEN*
At this moment, avoid arguments with People. When you notice people are showing anger, don't wait to settle them, move out of the place as quickly and quietly as you can. Just yesterday we lost one of our officers in Ado Ekiti while he was trying to settle an argument, he was stabbed and he died on the spot. Don't go to places of incidents to go and look what's happening.

*TWENTY*
At this moment, stay as close as possible to your home. Know the shortest possible routes to your home incase you need to get home quickly.
Always keep some change at hand. Not much, maybe 2k or less incase you need to board a public transport out of any trouble area.
*OPEN YOUR EYES AND BE ALERT.*
_Suspect everything including people and places._...

[7/12/21, 5:13:07 AM] Mom Airtel: Good Evening my good people. A new wave of robbery has been introduced in Lagos metropolis. And a relative of mine was attacked yesterday around Yaba axis. Two men wearing reflective Jackets pretending to be Task Force personnel waved him down and demanded to know him and his mission in that area. While this was going on, the Second man entered into the front seat and demanded the Car key. In a jiffy they became four men. He was overpowered with one of them taking over the driving. Along the road the hazard light was switched on to disguise. A POS was brought out for operation. They demanded his ATM at gun point while on motion. All the money in his account was transfered. Please wherever you see men in Reflective Jacket who are not in Police Uniform do not stop. They are all over Lagos now. Share this message to all your friends and contacts to be aware of this new trend. May the Lord save us in these perilous times.

[7/23/21, 5:50:10 PM] Mom Airtel: *Aging starts from the feet upwards ! KEEP YOUR LEGS STRONG !!*

▪️When we are old, our feet must always remain strong.
▪️As we grow old, we should not be afraid of our hair turning grey (or) skin sagging (or) wrinkles.
▪️Among the signs of *longevity*, as summarized by the US Magazine "Prevention", strong leg muscles are listed at the top, as the most important and essential one.
▪️If you do not move your legs for two weeks, your leg strength will decrease by 10 years.
▪️A study from the University of Copenhagen in Denmark found that both old and young, during the two weeks of *inactivity*, the legs muscle strength can be weakened by a third which is equivalent to 20-30 years of ageing.
▪️As our leg muscles weaken, it will take a long time to recover, even if we do rehabilitation and exercises later.
▪️Therefore, *regular exercise like walking, is very important*.
▪️The whole body weight/load remains and rests on the legs.
▪️The foot is a kind of *pillars*, bearing the weight of the human body.
▪️***Interestingly, 50% of a person's bones and 50% of the muscles, are in the two legs.
▪️The largest and strongest joints and bones of the human body are also in the legs.
▪️"Strong bones, strong muscles, and flexible joints form the "Iron Triangle" that carries the most important load on the human body."
▪️70% of human activity and burning of energy in one's life is done by the two feet.
▪️Do you know this? When a person is young, his *thighs have enough strengths, to lift a small car!*
▪️The *foot is the center of body locomotion*.
▪️Both the legs together have 50% of the nerves of the human body, 50% of the blood vessels and 50% of the blood flowing through them.
▪️It is the large circulatory network that connects the body.
▪️Only *when the feet are healthy then the convention current of blood flows, smoothly, so people who have strong leg muscles will definitely have a _strong heart_*.
▪️*Aging starts from the feet upwards*.
▪️As a person gets older, the accuracy and speed of transmission of instructions between the brain and the legs decreases, unlike when a person is young.
▪️In addition, the so-called Bone Fertilizer Calcium will sooner or later be lost with the passage of time, making the elderly more prone to bone fractures.
▪️Bone fractures in the elderly can easily trigger a series of complications, especially fatal diseases such as brain thrombosis.
▪️Do you know that 15% of elderly patients will die within a year of a thigh-bone fracture. 
▪️Exercising the legs, is never too late, even after the age of 60 years.
▪️Although our feet/legs will gradually age with time, exercising our feet/legs is a life-long task. 
▪️Only by strengthening the legs, one can prevent further aging.
▪️Please walk for at least 30-40 minutes daily to ensure that your legs receive sufficient exercise and to ensure that your leg muscles remain healthy.

*U may wish to share it with elderly friends and family members*❤️.

[8/18/21, 2:12:54 AM] DAD: BOMB SHELL  !!
*WE ARE AT THE END OF TIMES !*
  
Pope Francis cancels the Bible and proposes to create a new book. Pope Francis surprised the world today by announcing that the Bible is totally outdated and in need of radical change; thus, the Bible is officially cancelled and a meeting with high personalities  where the book that will replace it, as well as the name and the content, will be decided is announced by the church.
Some names are already under study and the most plausible is "Biblia 2000".
 «We cannot keep trying to talk to our audience in a completely new world with an old book of several thousand of years. We are losing disciples and we have to seek to modernize the church, rewrite the Word of God, even if it is only the Old Testament, in which there are certain passages which are better not to be repeated.«. The news fell like a bomb among the most conservative, who consider it as Pope Francis cancels the Bible and proposes to create a new book. http://thereisnews.com/pope-francis-cancels-bible/.  *What Bible are* *they talking about?* 
 *Be careful. We are in the last days...*

 *There is the false prophet who wants to change God's laws* 

2 Thessalonians 2:3-4 (KJV)
3. Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;
4 Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God.

The reading of this passage of the Scriptures confirms that the man in this position is called a *man of sin.* 
[3/6 12:48] Cheche Cyrille: *Where is the world going?* 

🔺1- Adultery is allowed in South Africa. No man or woman has no more the right to reject the other because of adultery.
🔺2- The United States has confirmed that in order for all countries of the world to establish good relations with the great powers, these countries must accept same-sex marriages (woman-woman or man-man).
🔺3- Germany had just signed the law which declares that incest no longer exists, that is to say, brothers and sisters can get married, mothers can get married to their sons and fathers to their  daughters.
🔺4- The city of Miami is now proclaimed a city where public sex can be bought. This means: in the streets, in the church, at the market place, on the football field, if you need sex you can enjoy yourself on the streets without having any problems.
🔺5- Canada allows bestiality (sex with animals). In Spain, pornographic films are allowed in high schools and universities.
🔺6- Underage girls are allowed to prostitute themselves. 
Marg Luker declares that any girl at the age of 10 years who feels sexual pleasure should not be forbidden to discover how her body functions.
🔺7- Finally, the USA has made it possible to open satanic churches publicly.

Dear brothers and sisters, the end is near, the departure to Glory is approaching. The Lord Jesus is really coming back soon! 

MARANATHA
▪Christians are allowing themselves to be distracted and the devil wants to take as many souls as possible with him in order to take them away from divine mercy. 
Let's be careful.
        *If you have a minute...share this message.*
    ➖Why do we sleep in church but stay awake in bars? 
     ➖  Why is it so difficult to talk about God but so easy to gossip?
     ➖Why is it so easy to ignore messages from God but easy to send  dirty messages? 
     ➖Are you going to send this message to your friends or are you going to ignore it? 

Jesus said: _"If you deny me before your friends,  I will deny you before my Father."_
       *If you love Jesus send this message to your friends and everyone if possible. Do it for the Kingdom of God. God bless you. Amen!!!*

[8/20/21, 5:22:33 PM] Mom Airtel: A friend died today of covid:
I'm sad to announce d demise of  Prof Banky Oke ( Gbemi's hubby).
He died of covid this morning. He was diagnosed just 2 days ago after he took a " pre- departure"   covid test as he was due to travel overseas.  
He rapidly got worse and was so sick yesterday,  he was admitted to uch covid center.  Alas he died this morning.  Just like that. 2 days illness.
BTW He was asymptomatic before he went for d covid test o. Secondly he was fully vaccinated.  
Don't know what to say than to be careful.  Covid still kills pple. Sad
3053385487 Lawrence Faleyimu. Re:. 2348131056374. CODIV 19 death. It was a sorrowful saga to hear from Prof Akiko that we lost Prof Banky Oke to CODIV 19. The CODIV 19 Variants are everywhere and killing with 2 to 4 days of it's awarenesses. Blessed your heart Prof Akiko for warming us again. Condolences to Prof Banky's families. Three months infants are under the list of CODIV 19, and the deaths are horrendous from infants, teenagers, adults etc in here including vaccinated people in US. Please everyone wear your mask. Let's do what we can to safe ourselves and others, wear the mask. A medical doctor from the State of Alabama, USA said when people showed up at Their Emergency Room or Theatre, they found the lungs have decomposed or decayed within 2 to 4 days and nothing can safe such patient. I believe we are all exposed to same infections rates, especially flying or travelling people and global movement can bring Codiv death to anyone. This is from a sister who works at the Virginia Health Department. I am sharing it.

With the new virus Covid Delta
 There is no cough, no fever.  It's a lot of joint pain, headache, neck and upper back pain, general weakness, loss of appetite, and pneumonia, it's Covid Delta!  

And of course, more virulent and with a higher mortality rate.  It takes less time to go to extremes.  Sometimes without symptoms !!  

Let's be more careful!
 This strain does not live in the naso-pharyngeal region !!  

Now it directly affects the lungs, which means that the 'windows', periods of time are shorter.

 I have seen several patients without fever, without pain, but who report mild chest pneumonia on their X-rays.

 Nasal swab tests are very often negative for Covid-19 !!, and there are more and more false negative results from nasopharyngeal tests.  

This means that the virus spreads and spreads directly to the lungs, causing acute respiratory stress caused by viral pneumonia.

 This explains why it has become sharp, more virulent and deadly !!

 Please, let's be more careful, avoid crowded places, keep 1.5 m distance even in open places, use double masks, face mask and wash our hands often (and when we cough or sneeze) 

Please no hugs and kisses, it is very dangerous at the moment, everyone is asymptomatic.
 
This * "wave" * is much more deadly than the first.  So we have to be VERY careful and take * all kinds of precautions *

 Please also be an alert communicator for your friends and family.

 Do not keep this information to yourself,  share it as much as you can, especially to family and friends.

*luggage experience in a plane*.

The older lady comes and sits next to me inside the plane. She asked me to help her put her bag in the overhead luggage compartment. But a gentleman sitting across quickly came through. (I am not very tall and the overhead luggage compartment is something I try to avoid at all costs.
 Immediately she sits down strikes up a conversation.  She was very pleasant and well spoken.  So we chatted all through the flight to Dubai. 
Suddenly, when the pilot announced that we were now proceeding to begin our descent into DXB, my good friend 'developed' stomach pains.  Me with my good heart, I pressed the stewards button, and the stewardess came to find out what the problem was.  I told her my seat mate was not feeling well.  And this lady, she suddenly began to address me as 'my daughter'. The stewardess told me that there was nothing they could do except give her some painkillers and wait until we landed.  The pilot announced that we had a medical emergency on board and advised us all to stay calm.  My new friend was crying and sweating like crazy.  And she refused to let go of my hand... everyone assumed we knew each other.  
So we land at DXB and the same gentleman who helped remove her luggage from the overhead compartment removed her luggage.  But as he removed the luggage, he advised me to distance myself from this lady and make it clear to the cabin crew that we were NOT travelling together. He was a godsend! 
So indeed, the cabin crew came and asked me if we were related, I categorically told them we had met on the plane.  I didn't know her at all.  So we began to deplane and as I said goodbye she kept begging me to carry her handbag. I was so torn... but the gentleman looked me in the eye and emphatically shook his head.  He passed me a note telling me to let the cabin crew handle her.  
So I exit the aircraft and leave my 'new friend' to wait for the wheelchair and be handled by the cabin crew feeling very guilty.  
As we waited for our luggage to come through, I hear this commotion. My 'new friend' was running, trying to escape the cabin crew, having gotten out of the wheelchair! She left the stewardess with her handbag and just ran towards the exit with the rest of her hand luggage! Luckily the airport police were faster than her.  They got hold of her and brought her back in handcuffs.  
This lady starts calling out to me.. my daughter... my daughter!.. how could you do this to me..... that's when I caught on.  She was carrying drugs and she was trying to implicate me! 
Luckily for me, the gentleman who had helped her with her luggage came forward and told the airport police that me and her had just met on the plane.  The police took my passport and asked her to reveal my full names if it was true we were travelling together.  By God's grace, I had not even told her my first name! I was still asked to follow the police to a little room where I was questioned extensively.  Where did I meet her?... where did I board...  where did she board. Etc... And my luggage was extensively searched and dusted for fingerprints.  
They dusted all her luggage and my fingerprints were not found anywhere on her luggage or on her handbag! 
*I was let go with advice never ever to touch anyone's luggage either in flight or at the airport*.  So from that day, I don't care how much luggage you have, you will deal with it yourself.  I will not even offer you a trolley to put your luggage on! Your luggage... your problem....  is my policy.  And if you can't reach the overhead compartment, and I am the nearest person, please call the cabin crew because all I will do is give you a blank stare and then look away!

If you have family members abroad who are planning to visit Nigeria, please tell them to take complete and very clear pictures of their travelling bags and luggage. before leaving their bases. They must take their pictures with all of their bags and save these on their phones. Reports reaching us confirm that some Nigerian airport agents are now removing tags from bags containing hard drugs and transferring the tags to other people's bags. This is a strategy to help their agents smuggle drugs into Nigeria. You will pick up your bag thinking its your bag because your name is tagged to the bag, and then you will be accosted, accused & arrested for having hard drugs in your bag. And sometimes, they will allow you to check out and take your bag home, only for their agents to visit you at home to kill you before collecting their bags. A lot of innocent people from America, UK etc are in jail now who know nothing about hard drugs but were picked up at Nigerian airports for bringing hard drugs into Nigeria. 

Please circulate this message to as many people as possible.

[9/14/21, 8:38:41 AM] ‪+234 803 385 5807‬: *9/11*
Twentieth anniversary of America's 9/11 terrorist attack on the World Trade Centre in New York has elicited several memories and stories from those concerned. One of such stories I read was about a 19 year old who said both his parents worked at the Trade centre. Both were at work that day, his mother pregnant with him. With nausea threatening her work schedule that day, the young woman stepped out of the building to take a breath of fresh air. In the twinkle of an eye, she turned back to witness a plane, 2 planes fly into the twin towers and that was it. The 27 year old husband she left in the office never came out alive. She, pregnant with their 1st baby remained outside, alive. The baby in the womb at the time lived to tell the tale 20 years later on. 

Other survivors told tales of delayed appointments, traffic delays, variety of circumstances which kept them away from the sad, shocking incident which took thousands away. What accounted for this- could it be luck, fate, chance?  Why do others survive what others die of ? Why do others escape what others suffer from? No one knows. No one can tell. But when Jesus was asked in Lk 13:3 about the Galileans whom Pilate slew and the 18 upon whom the tower of Siloam fell, he certainly did not ascribe those sufferings or calamity to the sin of those who died. 

It remains convincingly clear that we all live by the mercy of God. If the deaths that consumed others spared you, it's not by good works, fastings or know-how. It's by His mercy. True, prayers are instrumental to deliverance and preservation, afterall Christ asked us to pray," Deliver us from evil, lead us not into temptation." He admonished, 'Watch and pray, so that you will not enter into temptation'. But you better believe it, even the fact that those prayers are answered is a function of mercy that you have received from God.

Of more concern to me in this piece however is what our response should be as we see a thousand fall at our side and ten thousands at our right hand? 
1. We should live by faith not fear. He who has brought us this far is able to keep us to fulfil our assignments. 
2. Teach us Lord to number our days, the Psalmist prayed. As you reckon the days of life and the vanity of all earthly things, do apply your heart to wisdom, wisdom to live in the fear of God and to live each day for Him. 
3. Depend absolutely on the mercy of God for each day. We are alive by mercy.
4. Discover the reason why you are exempted from the events around you. What purpose is the remnant left behind for? Why then were you spared? As you discover fresh meaning to life, resolve to live purposefully, adding value to others and to God's kingdom. 
5. Remain steadfast, His eye is on the sparrow. Not one falls without his knowledge. 
6. Be ready always. The Lord's coming is nearer than when we 1st believed.

[9/15/21, 5:30:15 AM] Prof Tayo Makinde: *TAYO THE ILLITERATE*

Tayo was asked to go and buy few items from the market. Due to Tayo illeteracy, her boss  prepared him a list to help her buy accurately.

List: 
Milk   - N. 5,000.00 
Salt    - N. 2,500.00 
Oil     - N  7,000.00 
Fish    - N10,000.00 
Total = N24,500.00

So Tayo left the house around 10am,and at 3pm, she is not yet back from the market.

Her boss was so worried,and decided to call Tayo on phone.

Boss: 
"Hello Tayo, what's holding you? you have stayed too long,what's the matter?"

Tayo replied: 
"I have bought the milk, salt, oil, and fish, but I'm still looking for Total"

1) He flew into Nigeria from Germany using Turkish Air. 

2) He arrived Nigeria but one of his bag/luggage with his name tag was missing. He made a complaint and he was told to go home that the airport officials will look for it and give him a call 

3) He got a call around midnight that his bag had been found and that he should come pick it that night. He decided against going that night. He instead went to NAHCO in the afternoon.

4) On getting to NAHCO he was surrounded by over zealous Nigerian security operatives -DSS, NDLEA etc. The bag he was shown indeed had his name tag but it was not his own. Someone had removed his original tag from his missing bag and tagged it to the bag which had possibly hard drugs. 

5) He insisted that it was not his bag and proceeded to show them photos of his luggage which he took before arriving Nigeria. 

6) Despite the photos he went through rigorous screening that afternoon before he was let go. Suppose he did not have the photos. He said only God knows what his life would have become.

7) That same afternoon he approached Turkish airlines and caused a scene at there office. He said something about using his connection to make trouble with Turkish airlines and eventually Turkish airlines compensated him heavily. 

8) He advised all travellers to *always take pictures of their luggage* as that's what saved him.

URGENT ANNOUNCEMENT: TAKE PICTURES OF YOUR TRAVELING BAGS BEFORE GOING TO NIGERIA!

If you have family members abroad who are planning to visit Nigeria, please tell them to take complete and very clear pictures of their travelling bags and luggage. before leaving their bases. They must take their pictures with all of their bags and save these on their phones. Reports reaching us confirm that some Nigerian airport agents are now removing tags from bags containing hard drugs and transferring the tags to other people's bags. This is a strategy to help their agents smuggle drugs into Nigeria. You will pick up your bag thinking its your bag because your name is tagged to the bag, and then you will be accosted, accused & arrested for having hard drugs in your bag. And sometimes, they will allow you to check out and take your bag home, only for their agents to visit you at home to kill you before collecting their bags. A lot of innocent people from America, UK etc are in jail now who know nothing about hard drugs but were picked up at Nigerian airports for bringing hard drugs into Nigeria. 

Please circulate this message to as many people as possible.

URGENT MESSAGE TO BE PASSED ON TO FAMILIES AND FRIENDS IN NIGERIA. MAY GOD SAVE OUR COUNTRY FROM EVIL DEVICES. AMEN. 

From Kemi Filani Blog; How a female passenger disappeared in a commercial Lagos Bus yesterday. (Must Read) This is an eye-opener for us all! 

Please DO NOT collect money from any passenger when you enter a bus to be passed to the driver or conductor. Something bizarre but true happened at Ikotun Lagos yesterday at around 6:40pm and it's a great lesson for everyone. Read the mail I got below: kindly help warn people. My aunt just came back and she was shaking seriously for she witnessed a strange incident some minutes ago. She boarded a bus from her office to drop at Ikotun yesterday evening and unfortunately the bus had no conductor so one woman - one of them (passengers) decided to play the good Samaritan by helping the driver to collect the transport fare from passengers. Everyone co-operated and paid except one old man like that. Eventually he brought out his N50 and gave the woman to give the driver. Immediately this woman collected the money, she started shaking like someone that had been hit with epilepsy - 'warapa'. The shaking got so bad that the driver had to park and everyone started shouting on the old man to undo whatever he had done to the innocent woman, as it was after she collected the money from him that she began shaking. The old man now said they should let him rub the woman's breast so that the shaking can stop. While rubbing her breast, they both disappeared like film trick. Everybody in the bus shouted and scattered, even the driver fled. You needed to have seen the commotion. It goes a long way to collaborate Dr Olukoya's story during the last Power Must Change Hand. "A Bishop & Wife were travelling in their Landcruiser. They got to a filling station at Akure and were refueling when a lame man came begging. While the Bishop was busy with the fuel attendant, the wife deeped hand into her bag and gave some money to the begger, that was all. The Bishop's wife became  a cripple. People gathered and beat the begger, even took him to the police. They started  begging him to undo whatever he has done to the woman; he said the only remedy is for the Bishop's wife to kiss him. Another round of beating started. However, the police was in control and advocated the kissing if that will end the crippleness. Immediately that was done, the Bishop's wife disappeared with the begger and couldn't be found till now". 
Please help warn Nigerians to be careful. The kidnappers keep devising new methods everyday. 
Only God knows where the women are now". 
Please share to all your contacts.

In the market of Bwari, you find a poor woman with a baby at her back, you lower your car window and with a military abs rough command voice you asked her:

"How much are you selling those onions and bananas? " The poor seller politely replies, 
"#1,500 for a bunch of bananas and # 1,000 a pack of onions." With pride you demand the bunch of bananas at #800 and the the pack of onions at # 700 or else you will leave.

The poor seller resigns to fate and replies, "take them at the price you want. I have not made any sale today, at least I have something for supper now."

She has made a loss but she goes further to buy a plastic bag for you to pack two items you have bought. You order her to hurry up otherwise you may change your mind. She apologises and with a smile, she gives you the items and she blesses you for promoting her.

You literally throw the money at her and you speed away leaving behind a cloud of smoke and dust which cause a bit of discomfort to her and the baby. She is coughing while securing her little money. Her poverty has left her with no choice.

You have now arrived at the 5-star hotel (Pyramid Continental) where you are to meet friends and you ask them to order food and drinks of their choice. They order expensive food and the leftovers are more than the food they have eaten.

The total bill is # 65,000 and you pay without bargaining, you give a tip of #6,000 appreciating the waiter for a delicious meal which you didn't eat even half of it.

This incident might seem quite normal to you but it's inhumane...

THE POINT IS:-👇

Why do we always show that we have bargaining power when we buy from the poor? 

Why do we become arrogant when buying from the poor?

Why do we become stingy when buying from the vulnerable?

Why do we show generosity to those who do not even need our generosity?

Why do we become polite when buying from the rich who view our money as mere change?

Why do we channel money to a sea of money?

Please buy simple goods from poor people at high prices. 

Sometimes pay extra for the items you buy from poor women. 

#Please where possible buy items from local markets.

Please to all my beloved fans please everytime you  see them in Taxi parks,streets,just buy! Don't  bargain. They are not looking for money to buy expensive clothes or mansions or cars, but to feed their children back home and pay school fees.

     
       #support local sellers#

ANOTHER INTERNET BANK FRAUD SYSTEM DISCOVERED
A REAL STORY.
@ 1:30pm yesterday I got a phone call from 08148292037 who claimed to be Mr Benjamin from FBN Abuja. He gave my full names, BVN number, Date of Birth, my Alert phone number, which he called, also the 5 digit number I used to create my FBN mobile bank app.
He said that one Mr Usman created a Union bank account, and is trying to move money from my FBN account to the Union bank. He claimed he stopped the transaction, & is trying to verify if I authorised such transaction, which is the reason I have not gotten any debit Alert.
I asked him to go ahead to block the transaction, for I didn't authorise any online transaction.
He then asked if I gave my ATM card to anyone or used my ATM recently, I said NO.
He then asked if I have my ATM card with me, and demanded that I should read out the ATM digit numbers to enable him stop the transaction. I told him that he had already stopped the transaction, and have gotten a clarification from me, which is enough to enable him block whatever that needs to be blocked, if he is truly a first bank staff.
As I refused to call out the numbers, he then asked isn't this is the first 5 numbers? He then asked what's the next number? I told him that I will never read out my number to who claimed to be FBN`s staff over the phone, that I will rather go to any First Bank office & complain. He asked me if he is a ghost and not a FBN staff to get all my details.
As I pissed him off by not budging in, he switched off the phone.
An alert came in, as I checked the message on my phone, there was already a message from Union Bank, showing Account opening Authentication numbers 872395, 973392.
I quickly rushed to FBN. The Customer care personnel asked me not to bother about anything, so long as I didn't read out those numbers to him nor gave him my ATM pin or the three digits number at the back of my ATM card.
Please be guided. My people, it is so real & convincing that I believe some Fraudulent bank staffs connive with these DIE HARD HOOLIGANS to dupe innocent customers.
Please share widely ASAP.
I have shared this to you. You too can save someone by sharing. This is true. Just be at alert. Fraudsters are tactical. Don't be a victim.

Before he was elected speaker, Paul was a Congressman representing a congressional District in Wisconsin.

In all those years that he has served in Washington, he's been sleeping on an an Air Mattress in his office floor since his wife and kids are back in Wisconsin. Paul says that he can only sleep on a bed if his wife is sleeping on it or rent an apartment if his wife and kids are living in it.

When he was elected House Speaker, a position that comes with a Mansion, he chose not to live in it since his wife and kids did not want to move to D.C. But it's not just Paul Ryan who sleeps in his office in D.C. 

Out of the 435 American legislators (Congressmen and Senators) serving their constituents in Washington, 50 of them shower, eat, and sleep in their offices.

In an Interview with the AFP News Agency, Congressman Tim Walberg from Michigan said that he's been sleeping on his office floor since he was elected in 2007. Why? He says it's a good way to save money since house rents in Washington are ridiculously high.

He also had this to say: "I am not a king, a prince, or a Lord. The people who sent me here (Congress) are the people I serve. And I don't ever want to get to a point where I believe that because I'm here, I'm better than them."
Now, 200 legislators also share apartments. You got it right. 

Three to Five Senators can come together, rent one apartment, share the costs, and live together. They can also buy one car and use it to drive together to work. Yes, these are Senators and Congressmen from the largest economy in the world sleeping in their offices, sharing apartments, and cars.

In America, only the Speakers of both Houses and Senior Congressional Leadership have personal security. 
In Nigeria every MP's first priority is a big car, a house, a personal bodyguard. 

Even local assembly men/women are referred to as Honourable. Refuse to address him/her as such ,hell will break lose.
They live in mansion and own not less than 2 cars and you wonder why we are as we are as a dysfunctional country?

What the people of Nigeria need is a referendum to end this evil contraption called Nigeria and an emergence of the stifled nations within.      

We CAN NOT be silent about it. He that is silent in the days of the adversity of the oppressed, is more guilty and has taken the side of the oppressor.

[10/17/21, 1:11:18 PM] ‪+234 803 385 5807‬: AGING GRACEFULLY 
● To have a Long Life, the 10 years from 70 to 79 years are crucial! 
 
Israeli scholars have found that there are around two health problems per month for people between the ages of 70 and 79. Surprisingly, the health status of the elderly aged 80-89 is as stable as the 60-69 age group!

70-79 years is a dangerous period. During this period, various organs decline rapidly. It is a frequent period of various geriatric diseases, and it is often prone to hyperlipemia, arteriosclerosis, hypertension, and diabetes.

After entering the age of 80, these diseases will decline, and the mental and physical health may return to the level of 60-69 years olds!

Thus, the age of 70 to 79 years old is called the “dangerous age group”. As people grow older many people want to have a good healthy life. They realise that “Health is Wealth”.

The 10-year health care of 70 to 79 years olds is crucial.

Here are some simple steps called
“Doing *ten ones* every day”

This will help you to navigate more smoothly through the "dangerous age group" stage of your life. 

When the elderly are 70 to 79 years old, they may wish to do these "ten ones" every day. Here are the 10 tips:

￼ 1.    a pot of water

Water is "the best and cheapest health drink". 
You must drink a glass of water during the following  three times/occasions each day:

First cup: 
After getting out of bed, you can drink a glass of water on an empty stomach. 

Because of our invisible sweating and urine secretion during sleep, we lose a lot of water. Even if we don't feel thirsty after getting up, the body liquids will still be thick due to lack of water. Therefore, after getting out of bed, you must slowly add water as soon as possible.

Second cup:
A glass of water after exercise

The right amount of exercise is one of the cornerstones of longevity, especially for the elderly, and more attention should be paid to effective and reasonable exercise. However, after exercise, special attention should be paid to replenishing water. During exercise, sweat takes away electrolytes and consumes more energy. If you don't pay attention, it is prone to hypoglycemia after exercise, and even cause syncope. Therefore, after the exercise, it is recommended that the old people drink water to which a small pinch of salt and sugar can be added and dissolved if you wish. 

Third cup:
a glass of water before going to bed.... 

When people are asleep, sweat glands are still draining water. When the body's water is reduced too much, the blood viscosity is increased. A cup of water before going to bed can effectively reduce the blood viscosity and may even slow down the appearance of aging. Helps against Angina, myocardial infarction and other diseases.

2.   a bowl of porridge

If you feel sick, drink a bowl of porridge! Wang Shixiong, a famous medical scientist in the Qing Dynasty, called porridge "the first complement of the world" in his book.

China Daily Online published a 14-year study conducted by Harvard University on 100,000 people. It found that a bowl of about 28 grams of whole grain cereal porridge per day can reduce mortality by 9% and reduce the chance of getting cardiovascular diseases.

Each volunteer was in good physical condition when he participated in the study in 1984, but in the 2010 feedback survey, more than 26,000 volunteers had passed away.

It was found that those volunteers who regularly ate whole grains such as porridge, brown rice, corn and buckwheat seem to have avoided most diseases, especially heart diseases.

￼ 3.   a cup of milk

Milk is known as "white blood" and it is so to the human body. Its nutritional value is well known with a lot of calcium, fat and protein .

The recommended daily intake of milk and dairy products is 300 grams.

4.   an egg

Eggs can be said to be the most suitable food for human consumption. The body's absorption rate of egg protein can be as high as 98%.!!

5.   an apple

Modern research believes that apples have the effects of lowering cholesterol, losing weight, preventing cancer, preventing aging, enhancing memory, and making the skin smooth and soft.

The health benefits of different colored apples are different:

Red apples have the effect of lowering blood lipids and softening blood vessels

Green apple has the effect of nourishing liver and detoxifying, and can fight depression, so it is more suitable for young people to eat.

Yellow apples have a good effect on protecting vision.

6.    an onion

The Onion has a very high nutritional value and has many functions, including helping to lower blood sugar, lowering cholesterol, preventing cancer, protecting cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, and also anti- bacteria, preventing colds, and supplementing calcium and bones. Eat onions at least three or four times a week. 

￼ 7.   a piece of fish

Chinese Nutritionists have warned that “eating "four legs" is worse  than eating "two legs", eating "two legs" is worse than eating "no legs."

"Four legs" mainly refers to pigs, cattle, and mutton. Eating too much of these meats is not conducive to weight loss and lowering blood fat;

"Two legs" mainly refers to poultry such as chicken, duck, goose, etc., which are good meat foods;

"No legs" mainly refers to fish and various vegetables. The protein contained in fish is easily digested and absorbed. The amount of unsaturated fatty acids in the fat, especially polyunsaturated fatty acids, is relatively good for the body.

8.    Gentle walking

This has a magical anti-aging effect.  When adults walk (about 1 kilometre or less) regularly for more than 12 weeks, they will achieve the effect of correct posture and waist circumference, and the body becomes strong and not easily tired. 

In addition, walking exercise is also beneficial to treat headache, back pain, shoulder pain, etc., and can promote sleep.

Experts believe that a 30-minute walk a day can get rid of the danger of “adult disease”. People who take 10,000 steps a day will have a lower chance of developing cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease.

￼ 9.   a hobby

Having a hobby, whether it is raising flowers, raising birds, collecting stamps, fishing, or painting, singing, playing chess, and traveling, can help the elderly to maintain extensive contact with society and nature. This broadens the horizons of interest of the elderly. They will love and cherish life.

10.   good mood

Old people should maintain good emotions as these are extremely important to their health. Common chronic diseases which affect the elderly are closely related to the negative emotions of the elderly:

Many patients with coronary heart disease have angina and myocardial infarction due to stimulation of adverse emotions, resulting in sudden death;

"Bad" temper leads to high blood pressure. In prolonged and severe cases, this can cause stroke, heart failure, sudden death, etc.;

Negative Emotions such as anger, anxiety, and grief can cause blood sugar levels to rise, causing metabolic disorders in the body.

This shows how important it is to have a good mood!

Physical aging is a natural phenomenon, and it is the most sensible choice to fully devote yourself to life and to live the best every day!

COVID-19 VACCINE DATA ERRORS*: *A Stitch in Time*
 While commending the Nigerian government for their efforts in ensuring that Nigerians get all possible protection from the dreaded COVID-19 pandemic by making the vaccines available to Nigerians in all spheres of our national life, it is however crucial to quickly point out a very crucial observation, which may greatly embarrass Nigeria and Nigerians - especially those who might be travelling to other countries very soon. My observation is based on personal experiences on Saturday, 23rd October, 2021.
I was at the vaccination centre to get my second shot of the Moderna vaccine. The encountered bottlenecks in the procedure were nothing strange, considering our obtuse way of making every simple thing complicated. I managed to get the jab and left the venue. As soon as I got home, I decided to verify if all my data, especially my names and date of birth, were correctly captured. The card as designed has no space to indicate the owner's date of birth. That and other details regarding the type of vaccine taken and number of  jabs received are encoded in the barcode seal. I remember I had earlier installed a QR CODE READER app on my phone. I activated the app and scanned the barcode on my card. The result showed that my name was correctly captured, but my date of birth was 6 months and 5 days off. I quickly returned to the vaccination centre to demand that that crucial data be corrected. The officers politely agreed to verify from their databank. They discovered that the code reader was correct and immediately effected the correction. One young man who was there for his second dose approached me and asked how he could check if his own data were correctly captured too. I offered to scan his barcode and again his birthday was 3 years wrong. I scanned the cards of 4 others in the crowd and discovered that the birthdays of 3 were off on several scores. I returned to my Sports Club and shared the day's experiences with friends and members. This started us off on another round of barcode scanning. The results were baffling: out of the 8 scanned *only one* was without errors in the date of birth. The most disturbing was the case of a 60-year old gentleman from Anambra State who had completed 2 doses of the Astra Zeneca vaccine since June 2021 but  whose data read that he is 40-year old *Ahmad Sule* who has taken only one dose of the Moderna vaccine. 
The consequences of these errors are dire and are better imagined especially for travellers at the entry points of countries where the barcodes on travellers' cards would have to be scanned for verification. My intention for sharing this experience and observations is to encourage everyone who has commenced the vaccination process to go through the following simple steps:
1. Download any *QR CODE READER* or *BARCODE READER* app from the Google Play Store or Apple Store.
2. Open the app and position the aperture in such a way that the barcode will be completely inside the aperture. Once the scan is complete your full details will appear on the phone. 
3. Report any errors immediately at the vaccination centre.
 *Note* : I am posting this to my friends and groups in the hope that they will further share it across other platforms until the relevant officials get the message and take steps to correct possible glitches affecting people's data on the platform.

[10/26/21, 10:14:08 AM] ‪+234 803 385 5807‬: An elder whom I have enormous respect for sent me this post. Sadly I realized that nothing has changed till now. Our capacity for knavery is choking.

"Up till about 25 years ago, Singer Nigeria Limited had factories in Nigeria where they produced Television sets, Radios, Refrigerators, Standing fans, etc.

Singer had a unique corporate marketing strategy.

They didn't sell on cash-and-carry but on credit to their wholesalers.

I don't know the reason for this strategy though.

Soon, Nigerians began to apply as whole sellers using fake business names and addresses.

Many would pack the products and never paid up as and when due.

By 1996, Singer went down and closed all her factories in Nigeria!

At the Cocoa Industries Limited,  Ikeja, as the company was at the verge of closing down completely, I met the last MD  of the company.

As at that time, himself, his driver and four security men were the remnant members of staff of the company.

I asked what led to the terrible state of the company at the time when there was increase in the consumption of cocoa products.

He narrated his experiences in all the Oodua Groups; how the various MDs, GMs and Managers would collude with the drivers and security men to load products out without proper entries.
How those goods were delivered to oga's concubines in different towns and cities who would never remit the proceeds to the company.

Of all the over 150 companies wholly owned by Oodua Group, none is functioning again as at today.

Only those companies where Oodua jointly owned with others are working.

When next you are worried about the parlous state of affairs in Nigeria, maybe some children need to ask their parents to sincerely tell them the source of the money they used to build their various houses.

You may need to know the source of their wealth.

Is their wealth part of the over-invoicing or non invoicing of products and services?

Ask them, was it part of the shared "annual unspent budget"?

The ruination of Nigeria didn't begin in one day.
It was through minute indiscipline, impunity, arrogant exercise of power, ineptitude and greed.”

The indiscipline, impunity, arrogant exercise of power, ineptitude and greed still continue till today, not till we look inward and change our way, we will never see the Nigeria we hope for.

All the countries we are running to are not better than Nigeria, it is the people that are better than us.

Let us change our ways, and we will see the Nigeria we hope for.

The federal government launched e-Naira on Monday, 25 October 2021. This morning I have received tonnes of emails from Internet fraudsters asking me to register.

Because I know how to identify fraudulent emails, I was able to avoid being caught off guard.

One of the emails came from www.zenithbank.com.gh. This is supposed to be of Ghana. It looks real. But why should it come from Ghana 24 hours after the launch? I don't have an account in Ghana. Curious, if you ask me.

Zenith Bank Nigeria website address is http://www.zenithbank.com. Why is Ghana the first to send me a letter asking me to register for Nigeria e-Naira? Why hasn't Zenith bank in Nigeria sent emails like that?

They requested for my BVN, email, passwords, date of birth, phone number. Why?

Please be aware that as government is planning to make payments easier, Internet fraudsters are prowling, waiting for who to fleece of their hard-earned money.

Watch out. Be careful. Even if it looks real, like in my case, caution is advised.

Beware!!!

*A shocking example from history*
 
How powerful can the generational influence of parents be on their own family and descendants?
 
In 1874 a member of the New York State Prison Board noticed that six members of the same family were incarcerated at the same time. The board did some research, looking back a few generations to try to find the original couple who initiated this tragic family legacy.
 
They traced the family line back to an ancestor born in 1720, a man considered lazy and godless with a reputation as the town troublemaker. He was also an alcoholic and viewed as having low moral character. To make matters worse, he married a woman who was much like himself, and together they had six daughters and two sons.
 
Here is what the report revealed about the approximately 1,200 descendants of this couple who were alive by 1874:
 
• 310 were homeless.
• 160 were prostitutes.
• 180 suffered from drug or alcohol abuse.
• 150 were criminals who spent time in prison, including seven for murder.
 
The report also found that the State of New York had spent $1.5 million a shockingly high number at the time to care for this line of descendants, and not one had made a significant contribution to society.
 
Sadly, we can see by this example how the harmful dysfunctions of parents can be passed down from generation to generation.
 
A refreshing contrast
 
This second family study began with the famous preacher Jonathan Edwards, who was born in 1703. A deeply religious man, he lived a life of strong moral values and became a minister and a dedicated family man.
 
He married a deeply religious woman named Sarah who shared his values, and together they had 11 children. Eventually, Jonathan Edwards became the president of Princeton University. Here is what researchers discovered about the approximately 1,400 descendants of Jonathan and Sarah Edwards by 1874:
 
• 13 were college presidents.
• 65 were college professors.
• 100 were attorneys.
• 32 were state judges.
• 85 were authors of classic books.
• 66 were physicians.
• 80 held political offices, including three state governors.
• 3 were state senators.
• 1 became vice president of the United States.
 
What a difference it makes in the kind of example and values that are passed down to the next generation! Strong moral values can indeed bring blessings and opportunities for generations yet to be born!

*COVID-19 Permit*:*What I Went Through In France- Soyinka*

By Kazeem Tunde

 -October 29, 2021

Nobel laureate, Prof Wole Soyinka, on Thursday said he was prevented from boarding at the Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, France, for failing to obtain what the airline staff described as a ‘permit to travel’ to Nigeria.

Soyinka spoke in Lagos on the theme, ‘COVID, technology and citizen banishment,’ during an interaction with journalists.

He said although no attempt was made to banish him, he nevertheless felt like serving a decree of banishment for 48 hours that the event lasted.

Every in-bound traveller is expected to upload their COVID result on a portal created by the Federal Government, with the traveller’s details including passport, ticket numbers. At the end of the exercise, a barcode is generated, indicating a permit to travel.

The playwright who lamented his experience said, “Of course, there is something known as force majeure that means you cannot help it. If there are floods, or there is turbulence and your plane cannot land and it is turned somewhere else, yes we understand that.”

He added that when an individual “is prevented from entering his own country through the lapses of others, then there is problem.”

The elder statesman, who recounted two experiences, stated, “I had my vaccination, I have taken the 72 hours COVID test and I was negative. But apparently, there was one more, a new one called PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction), which the Nigerian government had begun to insist upon. I was away from the country at the time. I didn’t know this. I thought I was all geared up. I couldn’t get on that plane. I had to go back to Paris. I spent three extra days in Paris before I could get back to the airport, after taking the test and getting my result.

“But it happened the second time, just about a week ago.  This time, I had my PCR, and I still remained vaccinated. And of course, it did not happen to me alone; there were other Nigerians who passed the night at the airport. They couldn’t leave the airport because they had already passed through immigration. But at the gate, they were also turned back. This time, it was not PCR, or whatever it is called. It was that they had not gone to something called the Nigerian Travel Porter and obtained a permit to travel. Again, it was my turn. I said I have got everything, that I have the PCR. But they said no, that there was one more item which the Nigerian government now requires. So, I had to go back into Paris. Then I was directed where to go through a machine, and pay the necessary amount and then permission will be generated from Nigeria so that I could travel back to my own country. I rebooked, and the following morning, I was back at Air France. At the hotel, we tried to get on this porter, but we could not.”

He added that by 10am, he realised that he might miss his flight again, so he told the Air France about his challenge.

Soyinka said, “Together with Air France staff, between 10am and 2pm, we kept working. They brought their computers, some changed my password for me so that they could then try through their own but they could not. We succeeded maybe around 12 something in the receipt of the payment of my credit card being acknowledged. But it did not generate the permit to enter Nigeria, which has a square barcode. The process itself is really remarkable. I don’t believe that it was the Ministry of Health who created that questionnaire. I think it must be the Ministry of Internal Affairs. I invite you all to attempt to get on that portal and tell me what it has to do with COVID after the first couple of questions. What the majority of those questions have to do with COVID I understand. I asked them if there are other flights going to West African countries, which do not require this kind of secret service questionnaire, because that was what I consider it to be. And they said there was a flight leaving for Lome at 4.30pm. I told them to put me on it. Boarding began about 2.40pm; I carried my bags ready to go to Lome. In the meantime, one of the supervisors had come from the office. She was working with the phones like mad; sddenly, she broke into a sigh of relief and came running to where I was with my bags. She told me that she has good news for me, that I have been given special permission to enter my country. I don’t believe that I or any Nigerian should require special permission to enter his or her own country.”

Soyinka added that he didn’t believe that other nationals were obstructed from entering their countries the way Nigeria did for its citizens.

He added, “This is a plea to the Ministry of Health, Internal Affairs, which I am convinced must have participated in this form, to find out what is going on and why one should be subjected to this ordeal. Let us go out through the front door and come back through the front door as it is befitting to all normal citizens.

“Stop treating Nigerians like criminals and illegal immigrants who end up sleeping on couches or on the floor of the airport.’’

[11/15/21, 1:20:44 PM] Mom Airtel: HOW IMPORTANT IS BREAKFAST ?
Breakfast is the food eaten in the morning to break the long night fast. it's the most important meal of the day and it's extremely beneficial to your health and wellbeing. It enhances better memory and improve your productivity. It supports better health, mood and look. Although it's timing varies, depending on the individual need and schedule, nutritionists advise that breakfast should be eaten within two hours of waking up because it stabilizes your blood sugar which drops when you wake up in the morning.
A healthy breakfast contains all nutrients the body requires to carry out it's daily activities without breaking down. It also lowers low density lipoprotein (LDL) i.e bad cholesterol and the risk of heart disease, diabetes, and obesity. Majorly, the body need breakfast rich in protein, carbohydrates, vitamins and minerals.
As important as breakfast is, a lot of people avoid it. Skipping breakfast is unhealthy, and it's associated with health hazards such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. More so, it increases blood pressure and the risk of cancer. Even, children who don't eat breakfast could have low grade in school. Avoiding breakfast drops your acidity level which can result in stomach ulcer. Headache or migraine, and dizziness due to lack of glucose are also constant experiences of those who Skip breakfast.
Health is wealth.

ANOTHER INTERNET BANK FRAUD SYSTEM DISCOVERED
A REAL STORY.
@ 1:30pm yesterday I got a phone call from 08148292037 who claimed to be Mr Benjamin from FBN Abuja. He gave my full names, BVN number, Date of Birth, my Alert phone number, which he called, also the 5 digit number I used to create my FBN mobile bank app.
He said that one Mr Usman created a Union bank account, and is trying to move money from my FBN account to the Union bank. He claimed he stopped the transaction, & is trying to verify if I authorised such transaction, which is the reason I have not gotten any debit Alert.
I asked him to go ahead to block the transaction, for I didn't authorise any online transaction.
He then asked if I gave my ATM card to anyone or used my ATM recently, I said NO.
He then asked if I have my ATM card with me, and demanded that I should read out the ATM digit numbers to enable him stop the transaction. I told him that he had already stopped the transaction, and have gotten a clarification from me, which is enough to enable him block whatever that needs to be blocked, if he is truly a first bank staff.
As I refused to call out the numbers, he then asked isn't this is the first 5 numbers? He then asked what's the next number? I told him that I will never read out my number to who claimed to be FBN`s staff over the phone, that I will rather go to any First Bank office & complain. He asked me if he is a ghost and not a FBN staff to get all my details.
As I pissed him off by not budging in, he switched off the phone.
An alert came in, as I checked the message on my phone, there was already a message from Union Bank, showing Account opening Authentication numbers 872395, 973392.
I quickly rushed to FBN. The Customer care personnel asked me not to bother about anything, so long as I didn't read out those numbers to him nor gave him my ATM pin or the three digits number at the back of my ATM card.
Please be guided. My people, it is so real & convincing that I believe some Fraudulent bank staffs connive with these DIE HARD HOOLIGANS to dupe innocent customers.
Please share widely ASAP.
I have shared this to you. You too can save someone by sharing. This is true. Just be at alert. Fraudsters are tactical. Don't be a victim.

*Copied.COPIED.copied*

*TRUE LIFE EXPERIENCE*

*Kogi Born and Abuja based Pastor, Arome Wesley has yesterday reeled out the experience he had in a hotel room when he was at the western parts of Nigeria sometimes ago,*


*Below are the words of Pastor Arome Wesley:-*
*I resolved to share my private experience in a hotel to guide someone. Things happen, and it is safer not to be in the dark.*

*I will deliberately omit some details, for the sake of litigation. I got a few legal counsels when this event took place, and I will still keep to them.*

*Earlier this year I checked into a hotel in the western part of Nigeria, the hospitality was warm. The Receptionist, the Chef and the House Keeper, all welcomed me. I felt like a king.*

*Their POS network was down, so how to pay was a bit of challenge. I was then advised to use an ATM nearby. As I made my way to go, the House Keeper, Femi(real name) accosted me, offering to go use the machine for me. He pressured and pressured, but I wasn't comfortable with that, so I declined.*

*It was Chelsea vs Bayern Munich that night....I watched the game and slept off. I woke up about 4.30Am. It was a long sleep that night.*

*(Meanwhile, I noticed some red substance in the toilet when I returned from using the ATM. I had to touch some on the WC to perceive whether it was closeup toothpaste. Not suspecting anything untoward, I simply cleaned up the spots.)*

*At about 5.20Am, there was a knock at the door. It was mild but persistent.* *Eventually, I opened the door. It was Femi, the House Keeper, looking surprised and uncoordinated, visibly shaking. "What's it"? I asked. " Sorry, Sir, who are you?" were his first words to me(in whispers)as he kept looking beyond me to have a glimpse of the bed.*
*Not to bore you with narratives, I asked him to come in, and then the surprise. In his words,*

*"We did a sacrifice in this room before you checked in. And normally, after that sacrifice, the first person to sleep in the room dies before morning. I have worked with my boss for many years, and this sacrifice has never failed. That was why I wanted to get your card and the PIN details yesterday, so I could easily clear your account immediately.*

*"I was coming this morning with the Manager's extra key to quickly empty your bag of valuables before announcing death officially."*

*"Please help me; my boss mustn't know I told you anything."*

*I was stunned beyond words....*

*I must mention however that I didnt even have a nightmare that night.* *God be praised!*

*I will spare you some details. I actually left out so many details...*

*Things happen in our society..........*

*My thoughts:-*

*When checking into a hotel, make calls to your people right at the Reception about the details of the hotel. Let the management of the hotel know that people know your whereabouts. Be very sensitive to the voice of the holy Spirit, and above all keep your spirit man too charged for the devil, by praying long in the spirit.*

👆👆👆

*The above was shared with me by another Pastor Friend.*

*Please, share with your friends and families, especially those of us that are from the Diaspora.*

*I recalled sometime ago, I was in Nigeria and lodged in one hotel somewhere in Maryland in Ikeja. The room was nice and neat.*

*When I lay on the bed, I discovered my back was touching some sands on the bed. I looked closely, you know the kind of white sands you find on the beach side. They were all over the bed. I called the housekeeper. I asked him to change the entire linen on the bed or give me separate room.*
*It was curious bcos why would there be white sands on a neatly made bed.?*

*Things are happening in this world. It is a sign of the end time.*

*Remember the Otokoto saga in the Eastern part of Nigeria?*
*No one knew of ritual killings then.*

*These days any hotel I lodge in Nigeria, I do not go there alone. My friends or PA will accompany me there.* 
*They make sure I checkin, follow me to my room, before leaving.*

*#He that dwells in the secret place of the Most High, shall abide under shadow of the Almighty. I will say of the Lord, He is my Strength and my refuge... PS. 91.*


 *by Pastor Peters Omoragbon*

[11/25/21, 2:26:21 AM] Mom Airtel: *BE INFORMED AND NOT BE INVOLVED 0001.* 
A sister of mine narrated how she was robbed at a party in one of the Ijebu towns and I think everyone need to know and take caution.
This happened two days ago precisely on 20th of Nov 2021.
It was a wedding programme and after the Church programme everyone entered the Reception hall. People were been served with their choice of foods. In fact my sister said she stood up to collect foods for herself and the next person sitting beside her.
Immediately after they all ate, this same person sitting beside my sister collected a school bag from another man sitting around them and he pointed a short gun to my sister and said " *Eleyi o ki pariwo oo, just drop your phone in this bag* "
My sister humbly submitted her Android phone and according to her, she saw so many phones already collected from other *Alabase" like her.
Few seconds later she saw that two of them around her table stood up and moved and other ones within the hall also stood up from different tables and all of them close to 10 in number walked away.
 *Discoveries* : These guys came purposely to steal phones and they all bought and wore the party caps but not Ankara. They sat down two, two around different tables.
Everyone of them pointed gun at the next person to them almost at the same time and d bag was been passed from one person to the other so as to gather the stollen phones.
No body could shout until they left.
 *Lessons:.* You don't know the mission of the person sitting next to you in a party. It is not everyone that wear ankara, looking nice and sitting cool that were invited to grace the occasion.
 *Cautions:* 1, If possible, don't take big phones to parties again.
2. As much as it is possible always sitting together with your own people and don't allow any stranger around your table.
3. Stop being a photographer snapping yourself and everyone with your expensive phones, someone is watching you.

You and I will never be a Victim.

[12/3/21, 11:52:49 PM] DAD: Please when buying a new sim card be extra careful and vigilante.
Yesterday I saw some MTN guys selling Sims, I requested for 1 Sim card, I gave him all my details including NIN, after a successful registration I notice d guy was trying to register another sim with my details again, when I ask what for again? He said the first one was not successful, I insist he must provide the first sim he register he refuse, I then take my phone snap his picture and send to one of their senior colleague in the office, and was trying to call police, the guy started begging that he's sorry.

This type of sims they register, they sell it to kidnapers which may land you in a very big trouble. *PLEASE SHARE TO SAVE OTHERS*

I received a mail from *"EFCC"* with the details below:

Good day,
Please kindly find
 attached your invitation letter to our office on the 14Th of December 2021. All necessary details are in the attached document.

Note: Treat as urgent

Thanks
DSP   samuel ajiboye
Economic and Financial Crimes Commission
Address: 15A Awolowo Rd, Ikoyi, Lagos

I was eager to know what EFCC and I have in common that warranted such invitation to their office. So, I opened the attachment and it didn't open instead it took me to my Yahoo login details. 

Unfortunately, I logged in with my email and password and the attachment still didn't open. So, I left it and went to bed. This morning 13th December, a total of ₦548,900 was illegally transferred from my account.

The hackers changed my bank login details. They requested OTP for forgot password. They requested for OPT to create token seed and the bank granted them. All these transactions started from 1am today. They transferred my hard earned money to various account.

When I called customer care I was asked if I have my debit card with me and the answer was yes. The bank told me that they open a mobile app with my card on another phone to make all the transfers

Although I'm hoping that the bank will do the needful but please be alerted that scammers are daily upgrading their tactics to defraud people. *BEWARE OF SCAMMERS*

 *Lesson learnt* 
Do not open mail without checking the address very well. 

Do not login your details if you didn't initiate it yourself

THE Federal Road Safety Commission (FRSC) has just confirmed that you can now RENEW your Driver's Licence without going through the tedious capturing and biometrics.

All you need to do is.. go to http://www.nigeriadriverslicence.org, click on DL application, click on renewal of drivers licence and insert your licence number and date of birth. 

At the end of the form, select "NO" when asked if you want to recapture biometric information. With this, your information will be pulled out from the database and you can select the centre where you wish to pick up your permanent licence.

Those of us considering Retirement or are already Retired should read this and reflect on the lessons: 

There you have it!

📊📈📉📊📈📉 
An extensive study in the U.S.A found that the most productive age in human life is between 60-70 years of age.

The 2nd most productive stage of the human being is from 70 to 80 years of age.

The 3rd most productive stage is from 50 to 60 years of age.

The average age of NOBEL PRIZE winners is 62 years old.

The average age of the presidents of prominent companies in the world is 63 years.

The average age of the pastors of the 100 largest churches in the U.S.A. is 71.

The average age of the Popes is 76 years.

This tells us in a way that it has been determined, that the best years of your life are between 60 and 80 years.

A study published in NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE found that at age 60, you reach the TOP of your potential and this continues into your 80s.
Therefore, if you are between 60 -70 or 70-80 you are in the BEST and 2nd level of your life.

 😉I send you this information so that you can re-think when you say that you are old 😊

[1/24/22, 3:40:06 AM] ‪+234 803 410 3239‬: August 5, 1888 
Weisslock, a small village in Badan, Germany. People saw a strange sight. A woman in black gown rides a horse-drawn carriage with her two children.  But what surprised them was something else.There were no horses in front of the cart. A horse-drawn carriage without horses?  Shocked, the church bell rang and the priest gathered the people to face the "witch". Suddenly the cart stopped. The woman got out and checked the cart.
She walked towards the nearest hospital and then to the bar nearby. She asked for 10 liters of Legrain.  Legrain was a petroleum product. It was used to remove dirt from clothes. 
This was the first road trip in history by  Benz's wife, Bertha Benz and their sons Richard and Owen.

Watch the video released by MERCEDES BENZ Company to commemorate this event in 1888.

[2/3/22, 8:48:40 AM] DAD: *IN NIGERIA, IT IS WISDOM TO KEEP OUT OF TROUBLE, AS MUCCH AS IT IS PRACTICALLY POSSIBLE*

 *Forwarded many times.* 

One of the most prudent things you should do for yourself in Nigeria today is keeping out of trouble. One of the worst things that can happen to a person is to be sent to jail in Nigeria. 

Jail in Nigeria is halfway house  to hell. Maryam Sanda will probably never be executed, most Governor's do not sign the death warrant anymore. Orji Kalu Uzor will probably never serve full-time.

 
But still Nigerian prisons are like Nazi concentration camps. The food is calamitous, healthcare is none existent.

I have seen a prisoner holding his eye ball in his hand, it was still attached to his eye socket by a tendril. Someone used a spoon to scoop out his eye ball in a fight. The nurse was off duty. Nobody cared, he died.

I had a client once who was remanded in prison. He was HIV positive and did not tell me. Maybe that would have been further grounds for bail. He could not take his drugs and he relapsed. Before I could try to get him out it was too late, he died.

The food given to prisoners is not fit for human consumption, even animals should not be made to eat such rubbish. Meanwhile, huge sums of money has been budgeted for feeding prisoners.

Avoid trouble, infact, flee from trouble. Anything that will involve police charging you to court is trouble. If you can kill a matter in the police station, by all means do it. Stop shouting, 

"I know my right!"

This is Nigeria. Your right and left can change anytime.

Police will definitely ask for big money, if you have it and you suspect your case is not very solid kill the matter there. Even if you think you have a good case, this is Nigeria. 

If your lawyer is shouting, 

"we will meet in court!"  in Police station tell him to calm down. 

It is your case, not his. The use of "we," is merely  figurative. He will not stand in the accused box with you. 

Remember, it is not what you know that matters in court, it is what you can prove. Besides, this is Nigeria. Ihedioha can testify.

I was attacked once by a pedestrian in Lagos. The car I was inside brushed him slightly. I was not the one driving. I just told him to be more careful.

 That is how the guy attacked me. He threw 4 punches, I blocked two and dodged two. 

 I had the opportunity to counter punch but I did not. I am not Anthony Joshua.  A police man eventually stopped him. I quickly removed myself from the scene.

I was happy enough I was not going home with a broken jaw, neither was I being charged for assault. Sometimes it is better to let some things go.

I do not mean that you should turn to everyone's foot mat, but if you are going to take up an issue, ensure you are blameless, or almost blameless. 

Avoid wahala. If people are beating up a thief do not join, or even stand and watch, even if it is your property that was stolen. 

If someone hits your car don't start fighting because of that.

Do not lend people money. It hardly ends well. 

Do not surety people you don't absolutely trust. 

Avoid too much night movement, and partying and clubbing. 

Avoid people who cannot control their alcohol, they always start brawls.

Realize that a bad situation can always get worse, or better, depending on how you handle it. 

Avoid people who talk too much. 

Be wary with your speech. Do not talk about people behind their backs. 

Always assume that someone is recording your speech and videoing your actions.

Even if someone comes with negative gossip about another person, do not say anything. If you talk, it is what you said that will somehow find its way to the person's ear. 

Stop saying things like, 

" Do you know who I am?"

"I no dey fear anybody!"

"My yes is my yes and my no is my no!" 

Finally, remember to keep your anger and ego in check, the world does not revolve around you, it revolves around the sun 🌞.

[2/9/22, 2:51:15 AM] ‪+234 803 385 5807‬: Someone wrote 👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇

*3 years ago I was still exercising - cycling and fitness ... very fit and healthy ...
 But .. 3 years later I HAD A STROKE ...*

One day, when I stood up, my surroundings felt like swaying and my hands and feet felt tingling.

4 days at ICCU
15 days in the hospital room

Diagnosis results ...
*High blood pressure, thick blood, ruptured blood vessels in the right brain*

Got out of the hospital.
Every day taking endless medicine ...
Various health products ...
Resisting pain, massage, acupuncture ....
Sit in a wheelchair. 👩🏻‍🦽

Conditions like a 2 year old child learning to walk ...
It is not an easy condition !!!

I thought ...
Why do I have a stroke when I do regular exercise, no smoking / alcohol / stay up late ?

I just found out the real cause was,
*Long thirst ... lack of water ...!*💦💧

Here I want to remind everyone:
Remember to always drink water so that the body does not lack water!
*We need it every day.*
 Weight 1 kg = 30 cc
 Weight 60 kg=60x30 
 = 1800cc (at least)

*When traveling out, bring supplies of drinking water*
*There are people who say drinking a lot of water make them often go to the toilet*
 *My answer is...It is better to go to the TOILET often than to get STROKE!* 

Please always REMEMBER:
• Before / after exercise, drink 1 glass of water.
• Before / after eating, drink 1 glass of water.
• Before going to bed, drink 1/2 glass of *warm water*
• Wake up, drink 1 glass of *warm water* 
*May we all always be healthy even in our old age*

I share my personal experience to advise and for your consideration ...
(If we take enough water, it is not easy to get a stroke)

*Remember!  STROKE is no longer just a disease of PARENTS and MEN, but YOUNG children also suffer from STROKE*

*DRINKING ENOUGH WATER is a way of prevention*

After I finish driving I asked grandpa to rate my driving and you all know he couldn’t lie to save his life 
He said that was the worst driving he has ever since in his life and you all know that was the truth🤣
I couldn’t drive to save my life even now. If you don’t want to hear the truth don’t ask grandpa anything. Tell the truth and the devil to shame 😂

[2/12/22, 9:38:12 AM] Aunt Joke: He was so smart. For some of us who don’t know this, grandpa never went to high school or secondary. His parent were so poor. And he was the 1st generation to go to school in his village that has like 10 houses. After primary school he went to Adventist school in the north to teach so that he can earn money to send his siblings to school and from there he did the exam to the Adventist nursing school where he met his beautiful wife

[2/17/22, 4:02:02 AM] DAD: *Please post for Everyone and Hide My IDENTITY* 

I would have been a dead person lastweek if not God .
I am a Caterer and i reside and do business  in  port harcourt, last week a man walked into my shop he said he  works with a construction company and would be needing my services to deliver  snacks where they were holding  a  meeting,after negotiating he made part payment.
I called one of my old student to come assist me because the job was much. 
On the day i was to deliver the snacks i called him,then he asked me  to  board a vehicle  going to Igbo Etche in rivers state,and when i get to chococho i that i should  call him and he will send his driver to pick me, and i carried that my ex student along. When we got to the said bustop, he sent a bus with other persons  inside too..
From that point we rode for almost 20 minutes, at these point i began to feel uncomfortable and so i looked back to see who the other  passengers in the vehicle were,lo and behold the guy behind gave me a thunderous slap that i have never received since i was born..and shouted at me wetin you wan see,with a gun in his hand.
At this point i died 10 times and resurrected, we passed police check point and i tried to  give signal to the police men on the spot, but they were too busy collecting 100- 100naira to notice were in trouble.
After that checkpoint  our eyes where tied, and we journeyed for another 30minutes before they finally stopped at a place. 
They untied our eyes, we saw people  seating on the ground  crying,immediately we dropped one of them there was calling  an Alhaji on the phone that fresh meat don land and  they were arguing  price btw 3-4 million. When he dropped  the phone he said we should take of our clothes that he wants to check something, we hurriedly removed our clothes and they gathered to check our breast ,one of them asked me what the mark on my tummy was,I told them  it was from CS and they all exclaimed together “you don born”,I said yes 5 children ! They asked my student,she said she has 3children.
They got angry and started shouting which kain bad market be this ones ,they were so furious ..
i forgot to mention that all over the ground were decomposing bodies, i heard voices of people screaming inside the bush..and the sound of people butchering like an abattoir.
Men and women were coming and leaving with all sizes and shapes of coolers containing human parts..
In my mind I had concluded that we will soon be in coolers too,when the one that seemed to be their leader asked us who we will call to pay ransome since they can’t loose on both sides.
I kept pleading,and out of fear mentioned one million and they refused ...they asked my student who was by now half dead from fear..she told them she had no one on earth except her kids,that her parents died when she was 9 and the father of her kids just abandoned them and disappeared (which is true)..that she just came to assist me for the job,so she can have something to take home for her kids...
 They collected all I had and tied back our eyes and asked a bike man to drop us off close to the road.
I got home to see my 5 children crying and I couldn’t stop crying myself.
how would they have survived this wicked world without me?
My student is still in shock till now..
Pls thank God for me and be safe

Please don't be too anxious of business & money o. You can see that some contract could be end of the road. 

Not all calls for business or delivery order is genuine.

[2/17/22, 3:11:44 PM] DAD: NIGERIA POLICE FORCE WARNS NIGERIANS

*Members of the public are strongly advised to take note of the following:*

1. For your own good, whenever law enforcement agents ( whether in uniform or not) stop a vehicle you boarded, stay calm, avoid hissing and grumbling. Whether you are a man or a woman,
respect them.

2. Please take the receipts of your electronic equipment, laptop or other bulk gadgets (original or photocopy), anywhere you go if you must carry them. 

3. If you don't have means of identification from your school or workplace, get at least a national ID card or driver's licence. It is crucial.

4. Delete all your bank alerts, and transfer sensitive information into a flash drive or memory card.  Keep your financial transactions away from your phone. 

5. Carrying  more than Ten ATM card may bring serious problem for you in our present-day Nigeria : be warned !!!

6. If you must move at night no matter how close to your house, take your ID card and let someone go with you.

7. Dress responsibly - it will save you. Looking rugged and wild may earn you serious trouble. 

8. If you are given a vehicle to go for an errand, make sure all documents are complete and up- to- date. Also, your driver's licence must be compliant before you hit the road.

9. When your car is being searched, don't just look away in anger ; they are doing their job. Just
pay close attention to what's going on, to avoid "had I known".

10. If you are not sure of what someone is carrying in a bag, pack, or sack, please ask politely before accepting to give the person a ride. You may be arrested for what you know nothing about.

11. After any stranger you decide to give a help comes down, move forward a little, park and  search your vehicle very well before you continue so as to avoid harbouring any incriminating objects left behind.

12. It is mandatorily  necessary you dont keep this message to yourself alone...

[3/4/22, 7:23:27 AM] ‪+234 803 410 3239‬: WARNING TO: ALL WHO ARE AFRAID TO RELEASE THEIR BVN NUMBERS .
ANOTHER INTERNET BANK FRAUD SYSTEM DISCOVERED
A REAL STORY.
@ 1:30pm yesterday I got a phone call from 08148292037 who claimed to be Mr Benjamin from FBN Abuja. He gave my full names, BVN number, Date of Birth, my Alert phone number, which he called, also the 5 digit number I used to create my FBN mobile bank app.
He said that one Mr Usman created a Union bank account, and is trying to move money from my FBN account to the Union bank. He claimed he stopped the transaction, & is trying to verify if I authorised such transaction, which is the reason I have not gotten any debit Alert.
I asked him to go ahead to block the transaction, for I didn't authorise any online transaction.
He then asked if I gave my ATM card to anyone or used my ATM recently, I said NO.
He then asked if I have my ATM card with me, and demanded that I should read out the ATM digit numbers to enable him stop the transaction. I told him that he had already stopped the transaction, and he has a clarification from me, which is enough to enable him block whatever that needs to be blocked, if he is truly a first bank staff.
As I refused to call out the numbers, he then asked isn't this the first 5 numbers? He then asked what's the next number? I told him that I will never read out my number to who claimed to be FBN`s staff over the phone, that I will rather go to any First Bank office & complain. He asked me if he is a ghost and not an FBN staff to get all my details.
As I pissed him off by not budging in, he switched off the phone.
An alert came in, as I checked the message on my phone, there was already a message from Union Bank, showing Account opening Authentication numbers 872395, 973392.
I quickly rushed to FBN. The Customer care personnel asked me not to bother about anything, so long as I didn't read out those numbers to him nor gave him my ATM pin or the three digits number at the back of my ATM card.
Please be guided. My people, it is so real & convincing that I believe some Fraudulent bank staff connive with these DIE HARD HOOLIGANS to dupe innocent customers.
Please share widely ASAP.
I have shared this to you. You too can save someone by sharing. This is true. Just be alert. Fraudsters are tactical. Don't be a victim.

Beware

[3/10/22, 1:33:39 AM] DAD: Good Evening Family, 
Please l strongly appeal to everyone to be very vigilant and security conscious at home and especially in public, the number of undocumented missing persons is unbelievable kidnapping for rituals is at it's highest and they have deviced various very intelligent innocent ways of abducting people.

Before bad things happened mainly at night but today they operate freely from morning as you are going to work (morning rush), in the afternoon (as schools close) and in the evening as you closed for the day . 

Be very very careful in public places, taxis, bus stops, parties. 

Be very careful with friend (close friends) and even relatives, forget strangers completely. 

Be careful with your daily innocent looking appointments to some kind of offices or houses.

Always share phone number, details, photos and location of where you are going and where you are to your closest person, and make your host/friend see and hear that you have shared this information, especially for your uber/bolt/taxi rides (share your trip information with someone)

Please enable location on your device and photos.

Land travelling strictly only for unavoidable activities. 

Guard your drinks, cup and food at all times, never continue with your drink or food after it has been out of your sight for even a second, do this always & everywhere even if you are with your very close friends, colleagues and relatives.

Finally and most important, pray at every moment and be guided daily by the inner voice in you. 🙏 

WE ARE CURRENTLY IN VERY VERY VERY DANGEROUS TIMES.

*Low Oxygen Levels and My Headaches*

I woke up with a bad headache despite sleeping for eight hours straight. I took two tablets of paracetamol but it didn't work. I took a meal and called the studio that I wouldn't be coming to work today. They sensed it in my voice and wished me well.
I covered myself up to my head with duvet and slept. I woke up just before 2.00pm.

By the time I called Bissie Jagunna, one of my everyday gist partners at 2.15pm, my head was throbbing. She said I shouldn't delay before going to the hospital. 

So, I dressed up to go but I checked my blood pressure first (I always do this to know how best my doctor will help me and make his job easier. And I always make a list of what I'd eaten, taken or done before coming).

I called my son, Feranmi to let him know my whereabouts (I always do this in case I wouldn't be coming home again).

He encouraged me to seek medical help but told me what he said he was sure my doctor wouldn't tell me. He asked when last I opened my bedroom windows. I said it's been long because of the rains. He asked if I know what goes on in the night when I'm fast asleep and there is no electricity for the AC to work. I said I didn't know. He then lectured me.

Feranmi explained to me that when the windows are shut and there is no AC on, the level of oxygen drops and the brain cells begin to die. He said there are many brain cells, but once they start dying gradually, one will start experiencing some of the symptoms I've been having. It was a full lecture.

While we were talking, I opened all the windows in the house and sat down for a while. Within 20 minutes, the headache had disappeared. The only memory of it is the feel of Aboniki around my neck.

I did my own Google search and below is what I got. I hope it will help someone out there. But please, always talk to a doctor when symptoms persist. May we all have very healthy and happy lives, ameen.

Thank you Fernami.

Low blood oxygen levels can result in abnormal circulation and cause the following symptoms:

shortness of breath
headache
restlessness
dizziness
rapid breathing
chest pain
confusion
high blood pressure
lack of coordination
visual disorders
sense of euphoria
rapid heartbeat

Causes
Hypoxemia, or oxygen levels below the normal values, may be caused by:

*not enough oxygen in the air*
*the inability of the lungs to inhale and send oxygen to all cells and tissues*
*the inability of the bloodstream to circulate to the lungs, collect oxygen, and transport it around the body*
Several medical conditions and situations can contribute to the above factors.

[3/21/22, 9:17:02 AM] Mom Airtel: HOW MY SON WAS RESCUED FROM KIDNAPPERS 

Like the previous days of the week, Wednesday, March 16th 2022 started like any normal day for my son, Alamin Saleh Bature, a National Youth Service Corps member and graduate of Information Communications Technology from the University of Cape Coast, Ghana. 

His mother revealed the news of his Kidnapping to me at a time I was about to retire to bed by 9:30pm. It was like a dream. How my wife came into the room, her countenance and the way she was breathing, holding a cellphone to her ear showed that there was something amiss about that telephone conversation. Visibly disturbed and disoriented, she looked at me and said, ‘’Alamin has been abducted, but thankfully, the man I have spoken with told me he is safe at Garki police station and one kidnapper was arrested.’’

Ordinarily, Maitama Amusement park (MAP) should be the last place to expect a kidnapping operation in Abuja. The park is a bustling resort full of family fun, excitement and an array of activities and eateries. Unfortunately, it was at this spot that the three young men who were camouflaged as police men abducted him. The incident occurred around 7:30 pm.

The kidnappers accosted him and accused him of thievery and dope pedaling. They handcuffed him and forced him into a waiting Toyota corolla car. As soon as they sped off and out of the sight of the people at the park, they asked their captive to give them N1000,000 to bail himself and go scot-free. They stopped at the access bank branch at Aminu Kano Crescent, Wuse 2 where they forced him to empty his account by withdrawing the last N30,000 in the account.

To frighten and compel him to succumb to their demand, they took him to a dark spot near the former SARS office, a notorious Nigerian police detention cell equivalent to the former USSR prison camp at Serbaria. It was at this point that the urgency to scape and save his life from from the captivity of those wolves dawned on him. He told them that the transfer he was expecting must have entered his account. Unknown to the greedy and wicked criminals, it was this attempt to get more money from their abductor that led to freedom for my son and the arrest of one kidnapper who incidentally owned the vehicle with which they committed the crime.

At the Zenith back branch on Lagos Crescent, he ran away to save his life. They pursued him until he fell to the ground because of exhaustion. A commotion broke out when Alamin told the crowd about what had transpired and showed the receipt of the N30,000 they forced him to withdraw from his account and give them. As the commotion ensured, an ‘’ambush team’’ of security men arrived the scene. Two of the kidnappers escaped with the vehicle but one was arrested.

On reaching the Garki Divisional Police station on Lagos Crescent, Garki II, two armed police officers at the gate showed me to a parking space and led me to the office where my son was writing his statement. On the floor near the entrance to the office, I saw a young man, light in complexion handcuffed to a steel column (who was obviously the kidnapper), some armed police officers in uniform, two men in traditional Hausa attire and a light-skinned, well-built man with a thick and full moustache in a jeans trouser and a T-shirt who was later introduced to me as God Power Chinaechrem.  

God Power, a Christian of Igbo extraction and the other 2 Hausa men I mentioned earlier were the good Samaritans God used to rescue my son. When one kidnapper showed his fake police identity card and were about to go with Alamin, he held God Power’s hand firmly and said, ‘’I am not a thief. Don’t allow them to go with me, please.’’ Like a revelation from above, God Power felt that the victim was innocent of the spurious charges against him.

God power said, he saw the innocence in the eyes of the hapless and helpless young man and he empathized with him immediately. He questioned why they did not detain their alleged criminal at the Maitama Police station? He therefore insisted that the boy must be taken to the Garki police station which was not more than 100 meters away from them. It was at this point the security men arrived the spot and God helped them to arrest one of the three kidnappers.

It is important to share this unpleasant experience for people to know that there is now no safe place in Nigeria. We should not take our personal security for granted. kidnappers can operate with ease and impunity anywhere in Nigeria. They have changed tactics with which they can easily deceive gullible people. They have the audacity to move around with handcuffs, pepper spray, fake id cards, uniforms, guns, duty belt, badges and other police officer equipment and accessories to deceive and arrest innocent bystanders in public places. It has happened to my son. It is really a traumatizing experience and trial that could happen to anybody at an anytime.

May the supreme lord of the worlds, who has power over all things protect us from the evils of kidnappers. May He also expose and punish them for their crime.

 The skin secretes sweat which contains leptin, the laziness hormone

 So why do we walk????

 I hope everyone reads this answer:

 * * We walk in order to relieve stress and psychological pressure...

 * We walk to lose weight...

 * We walk to cure diabetes and cholesterol...

 * We walk to activate the kidneys, liver and eye functions...

 *  We walk to activate the work of the heart and reduce the stiffness of the arteries...

 * We walk to relieve symptoms of colon and digestive disorders...

 We walk to activate our immune system...

 * We walk to activate our muscles and bones, and strengthen our health.

 Every reason mentioned above represents a mighty goal for walking by itself....
 and the fact that doctors and experimenters do not dispute says that all these diseases are cured by walking.

 * Doctors say:  There is no physical or psychological disease except that walking plays a role in its treatment.. If a medicine that was released to the market has benefits similar to those of walking, the doctors would spend it on every prescription and patients would buy it at the most expensive price.  But the irony is that walking is an effective and free medicine, and patients are reluctant to take it!!!

 A word I liked from a doctor who says: If a walking track was built around every hospital, and people walked around it, half of the people who are in it would not have entered the hospital, and half of the people in it would have left the hospital!

 We were created to walk..but they made us sit on the couches, and when diseases swept us, they didn't take us back to walking, but carried us to lie on the white beds waiting....!!

 Take care of your movement, your health and happiness will last and continue walking. No matter how you feel each day, get up, get going and make the most of the day. 
*Never give up*.

The family of a businesswoman, Fatima Isa, have demanded justice after she died during a fibroid surgery at the Felobam Alpha Clinic in the Mafoluku area of Oshodi, Lagos State.

PUNCH Metro gathered that the victim, alongside her sister, Queen, left their hometown in Auchi, Edo State, and travelled down for the surgery at the medical facility.

When the sisters got to the hospital last Thursday, Fatima was admitted and Queen slept over at the hospital.

Speaking to our correspondent, Queen said the management of the hospital demanded N190,000 for the surgery, adding that she left her sister in their care to withdraw the money.

She said, “The money was in my account, so, I went to the bank, withdrew the money, but when I returned to the hospital around 1.35pm, they had already taken my sister to the theatre to perform the surgery despite not signing any form.

“When I did not hear from them for four hours, I called one of the nurses to know what’s happening but was told that they were cleaning her up. Around 5pm, the doctor walked out of the hospital and as I asked after my sister, she said she was OK.

“Later, they brought my sister out. But when I saw my sister, she was breathing abnormally. I quickly alerted the doctor and nurses and the person assisting the doctor came and started hitting my sister’s laps.

“When my sister shook her head, the assistant doctor said she was OK, simply because she shook her head. But as he stepped out, she started breathing heavily and all of sudden, she stopped breathing and that was how she died.

“I quickly called the doctors and nurses again. When they rushed in, they said I should go out, but I refused. I started shouting and crying. I called one of my sisters, Kate, and she came around 8pm. We both slept where Fatima’s corpse was dumped in the hospital.

“The doctors and nurses just abandoned us there. Early in the morning, I called my sister in Asaba, who told us to call our cousin, Momoh, who was in Lagos. We want the government to help us get justice for what they did to my sister. We heard the person that operated on my sister is not even a doctor.”

Momoh alleged that the doctor who performed the surgery was an impostor.

She said, “Fatima’s last words while gasping for breath was ‘God have mercy on me.’ When Queen alerted the doctor as she was breathing abnormally, they gave her an injection, but she continued struggling to breathe and died.

“When she called us, we rushed to the facility. I became angry because the whole place was worse than an abattoir. We asked the doctor what happened and he told me that after the surgery, she developed cardiac arrest and died.

“I asked the cause of the cardiac arrest, but the doctor was just speaking like an illiterate and could not even make a complete sentence, and he is running a hospital in Lagos State of all places.

“We asked for her file and they brought out a paper, but there was nothing in the file to indicate that a test was carried out before the surgery. We asked who performed the surgery and we were told one Lawrence, and that he works with LASUTH.

“We collected Lawrence’s phone number, but he didn’t pick his call. We later got to know that he is a nurse and not a doctor. We got the death certificate, which was signed by Lawrence, and reported at a police station in Mafoluku because we want justice.”

In a video clip obtained by our correspondent, one Felix, who was said to be running the facility, was heard telling Momoh that Fatima died of cardiac arrest.

However, calls and a text message sent to Felix to get a reaction regarding the circumstances surrounding the victim’s death were unanswered.

Our correspondent contacted Lawrence for a reaction, but he did not take his calls and had yet to respond to a text message regarding the incident.

The state Police Public Relations Officer, Benjamin Hundeyin, said two suspects had been arrested in connection with the death of the businesswoman.

He said, “Two people, including the nurse that did the operation, have been arrested. They have been transferred to the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department, Yaba, for further investigation.”
[4/13/22, 5:15:20 PM] Aunt Joke: That was the reason bro Muyiwa refused for me to do my surgery in Nigeria

When he was in a Private school he got the following results:

Social Sciences = 1%

He was taken to a government school and got the following results:

Maths = 0%
English = 1%
Science = 0%
Social Sciences = 0%

His parents were very disappointed but still decided to put him in a Christian school even though they were not Christians.
The First term Haruna passed and was the first in the class.

Maths = 90%
English = 93%
Science = 95%
Social Sciences = 89%

His parents could not believe it. They asked him how he managed to pass and he said;

[4/26/22, 5:10:06 PM] ‪+234 803 410 3239‬: *Sad information but very useful* 

This is an unfortunate observation made in some houses. 

Pots, water cans and other containers are often either uncovered or poorly covered. And generally, it is the women (daughters and mothers of families) who are super qualified in this. 

Read this story, even if it shocks you, please share it as much as possible with your contacts, especially with female beings. 

A couple, whose wife is menopausal, has just lost *05 children* because of the *recklessness* of the mother who is not used to covering her pans after cooking. 
Indeed, accustomed to sharing the table with her husband, she first served her 05 children, good sauce with cow meat accompanied by fufu, while waiting for dad to come. 
Thirty minutes after eating, 4 of the 5 children stopped breathing without crying. 
The last child was still moving when the mother entered the living room when the first 04 had given up their souls. 
Crying for help, the last one followed his brothers. *All 05 boys died.* 
After the autopsy of the medical examiner at the request of the parents, it was found that the children were poisoned. 
Who could have done such an act? Is it their own mother? No visitor arrived at the house and all these children did not go out, it was Sunday. 
After examining the pot in which the meat was prepared, it was found that the corpse of a gecko (a *small mangy lizard that crawls on the walls of houses)* was in the sauce. Mom admitted to not having covered the pot. 
The sauce being hot, the little reptile drowned in it, thus secreting its toxic substances which carried off these victims of maternal imprudence. 
The mother, menopausal, wants to commit suicide. But she is kept by the police in her own house. 
If they had all eaten at the same time, the whole family would have died on the same day. 
Let the woman or the man who has ears hear well. 
If possible, *Share* as you wish and save at least one life
Life is precious 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏

  *Tips for those who have reached Over:*
   the *40years*
   the *50*
   the *60*

 *First tip:*
 Always drink water even if you don't feel thirsty or need it... the biggest health problems and most of them are from the lack of water in the body. 2 litres Minimum per day (24 hours) 

*Second tip:*
 Engage in regular exercise even when you are at the top of your preoccupation...the body must be moved, even if only by walking...or swimming...or any kind of sports. 🚶 Walking is Good for a Start... 👌

 *Third Tip:*
Reduce food...

 Leave excessive food cravings... because it never brings good. Don't deprive yourself, but reduce the quantities. Use more Of vegetables, fruits and fiber foods.

 *Fourth tip*
 As much as possible, do not use the Car unless absolutely necessary... Try to reach on your Feet for what you want ( grocery, visiting someone...) or any goal. Climb Stairs, than use Elevator,  Escalator

*Fifth tip*
 let go of ANGER...
 let go of Anger...
 let go of anger...
 Let go of Worry.... try to overlook things...
 
Do not involve yourself in situations of Disturbance... they all diminish health and take away the splendor of the soul.  Choose a babysitter you feel comfortable with. Talk to People who are Positive and Listen 👂 

*Sixth tip*
 As it is said..leave your Money in the Sun.. and sit in the Shade.. don't limit yourself and those around you... money was made to live By it, not to live For it.

*Seventh tip*
 Don't make yourself feel Sorry for anyone, nor on something you could not Achieve,
  Nor anything that you could not Own.
 Ignore it, Forget it;  

*Eighth tip*
Humility.. then humility.. for Money, Prestige, Power and Influence... they are all things that are corrupted by Arrogance and arrogance..
 Humility is what brings people Closer to you with Love. ☺ 

*Ninth tip*
If your hair turns Grey, this does not mean the End of Life.  It is proof that a Better life has Begun. 🙋 Be Optimistic, live with Remembrance, Travel, Enjoy yourself. Make Memories!

*It may help someone when you share it*👀

[5/11/22, 5:17:05 PM] Mom Airtel: *IF ANYONE DIES, LIFE GOES ON.LEARN THE LESSON, DON'T BE THE THE LESSON.* 

 I left the house in the morning and I told my wife I will return before evening. By the time I closed, it was 11pm.

On my way back home, I got a call that a little girl was rushed to the hospital almost lifeless. She was raped by a 60year old man. 

I turned the car and went back to the hospital. 

I was in my office till 4am in the morning when that child regain consciousness. I waited till 6an in the morning to go home. 

Getting into the car, a police van drove into the premises, they needed to speak with me. I finished speaking with them and got a call from the DPO that the community head was at the police station with their lawyer trying to get the man on bail.

I put a call to my wife and told her to help me drop the kids in school, that I was heading to the police station. 

Knowing how complicated the issue was becoming, I quickly asked my lawyer to get a remand order to keep the rapist. 

Before I got home that day, it was 4pm.

Wanting to be a good father, I left the police station, drove straight to my children's school and picked them.  I know that I got home, but what I didn't know is how I got on the hospital bed. 

I was told I slumped and was brought to the hospital. All that was for people's problems. 

I was kept there for 1week.

In one week, there were problems that people still solved without my knowledge. In one week, life adjusted itself without me. 

In one week, I didn't take one call and heaven did not fall. 

Dear Sir/Ma

You will die young and your family that looks up to you will suffer because everyone will revert to factory setting. 

Serve humanity but don't die for humanity. One death is enough, you don't need another. 

In the last two months, I have not gone to the office, and no one has died. If you cannot be attended to by someone else except I sit on that chair then your problems can only be solved by God Himself. 

I don't have the capacity. Do the little you can and leave the rest to God. 

God never forgets.
[5/12/22, 1:59:12 AM] Prof Tayo Makinde: Public Attention!!!!!

Your BANK Account
could be Emptied
without an Alert.

Dear All,

Please let's be
very careful.. There is a
new HIGH TECH FRAUD
in town called the SIM
SWAP FRAUD, and
hundreds of persons
are already VICTIMS.

How does it work?

1 A new fraud called
SIM SWAP has started.
Your phone network will
momentarily go blind /
zero (No Signal / Zero
Bars) and after a while
a call will come through.

2 The Person on the end of the call will
tell you that he is calling
from (your cell phone
company) depending on
your network and that
there is a problem in
your mobile network.

3 He will instruct you to
Please press 1 on your
phone to get the
network back.

- Please at this stage
don't Press anything,
Just cut or END the call.
If you press 1, the
network will appear
suddenly and almost
immediately go blind
again (Zero Bars) and
by that action, your
phone is #HACKED.

Within a second they
will empty your bank
account and you won't
receive any alert.

What you will
experience.
It will appear as though
your line is without
Network, meanwhile
your SIM has been
SWAPPED.

The danger here is
that, you will not get
any alert of any
transactions, so, please
those of us doing USSD
Banking and Mobile
Banking BEWARE.

Let's
be very careful.

Please, forward to your
contacts, loved ones
, and friends. The fraud
is increasing day by day.

[5/20/22, 2:22:25 PM] Aunt Joke: Hello family 
There is a great scarcity of infant milk formula in United state right now because they closed down the factory due to 2 infants death and for the one month it has been bad because most American doesn’t breastfeed 
If you know how many calls I get in a day from desperate moms asking what they should do, it is ridiculous 
I told them in Africa we don’t have this problem because they breastfeed babies until they are at least 1 yr.
It is so sad that most white will breastfeed their babies but the black especially those not educated will not breastfeed at all 
When they bring the babies for their 1st visit after leaving hospital when baby is like 4 days and we asked them what the baby eat they said formula because most of them get it free 
I told one of them yesterday that you all what to identify with Africa so bad but don’t want to do what we do in Africa like breastfeeding and she said it is a lot of work to breastfeed and I said yes it is but if it is the best thing for you and your baby I think you should give it a trial
[5/20/22, 2:36:49 PM] Joke: I read about the scarcity. I was surprised to find out brestfeeding is a luxury in America and less than 10% even do exclusive brestfeeding
[5/20/22, 2:43:56 PM] Aunt Joke: It is so sad when you see immigrants from Mexico that can not say a word in English not breastfeeding their babies also because they get free formulas but not Nigerian 
I went to Tj max 2 weeks ago and I saw a black lady sitting down on the step breastfeeding her baby talking to her husband and I said to myself she is from Africa and when I moved close to them she was telling the husband in yoruba that dress will be good for Kehinde but I was almost late for work that so I couldn’t talk to them
[5/20/22, 2:45:40 PM] Joke: Here women are actually shamed when they don't breastfeed. I would have expected that in an advanced country they should know how important it is to breasfeed
[5/20/22, 2:47:04 PM] Aunt Joke: They know but they don’t care and they are so so so lazy
[5/21/22, 3:25:32 AM] ‪+234 803 385 5807‬: Is it actually laziness that's stopping them? Because I think it is easier to just bring out your breast and feed the baby than preparing formulas. Maybe they think breastfeeding will affect the shape of their breasts
[5/21/22, 7:08:55 AM] Aunt Joke: That and they didn’t prepare formula 
Some of them are pre-mixed
[5/21/22, 7:26:12 AM] ‪+234 803 385 5807‬: Okay
[5/21/22, 7:44:49 AM] Joke: Pre mixed formula 🤣🤣 oyinbos love soft life
[5/21/22, 7:56:49 AM] Aunt Joke: They do and what they do is pour and give it to the baby to feed themselves or hokd the bottle with a cloth under to feed the baby while they are on Facebook

[6/4/22, 9:25:08 AM] Mom Airtel: *BAY LEAVES*

Many ladies add bay leaves to our foods, especially in the cooking of red meat and poultry meat.

Many of us don't know why bay leaves are added to food!
When a woman was  asked why, she said, "to flavor the food".

If you boil the bay leaves in a glass of water and taste it, it will have no flavor.

So why do you put bay leaves in the meat or other food?

The addition of bay leaves to meat converts triglycerides to monounsaturated fats, and for experimentation and confirmation:
Cut a chicken into two halves, cook each half in a pan and place on one bay leaf, and the other without bay leaf. Observe the amount of fat in both pans.

If you have bay leaves, there is no need for a pharmacy.  
As recent scientific studies have shown that bay leaves have many benefits.

It helps to get rid of many serious health problems and illnesses.

The benefits of bay leaf are: -

Bay leaf treats digestive disorders and helps eliminate lumps.

  Heartburn,

  Acidity

  Constipation,

It regulates bowel movement by drinking hot bay tea.

It lowers blood sugar and bay leaf is also an antioxidant,

It allows the body to produce insulin by eating it or drinking bay tea for a month.

Eliminates bad cholesterol and relieves the body of triglycerides.

Very useful in treating colds, flu and severe cough as it is a rich source of vitamin "C". You can boil the leaves and inhale steam to get rid of phlegm and reduce the severity of cough.

Bay leaf protects the heart from seizures and strokes as it contains cardiovascular protective compounds.

Rich in acids such as caffeic acid, quercetin, eigonol and bartolinide, substances that prevent the formation of cancer cells in the body.

Eliminates insomnia and anxiety, if taken before bed, helps you relax and sleep peacefully.

Drinking a cup of boiled bay leaves twice a day breaks kidney stones and cures infections ...

[6/8/22, 1:21:44 PM] Aunt Joke: I am buga the people at my place of work because they make me angry last week 
For 5 year i worked on every Saturday and I get to work one hour early to run the controls and get everything ready without getting paid for it 
Last week the CEO said I have to many overtime that I have to cut my overtime and I explained they keep calling me in but he wasn’t ready to listen to me and I know if I don’t do what he says I will loose my job so I told myself don’t pick no call or respond to no text from work until you get to work 
They have been texting and calling all day today 
I said to myself they have messed with the wrong person just because I’m from Nigeria doesn’t mean I don’t know my right.  The doctors i worked with said he doesn’t know there is no pediatric floor or vaccines clinic without you

[6/16/22, 12:53:44 PM] Aunt Joke: Last year, during Candace graduation she opened a gift registry for the family group 
She specified what she needs and the price so we all picked from the registry 
She did this because we all know when you do things like that people give you a lot of things you don’t need or duplicate them 
So for the Ogunola’s the group is going to open gift registry for the baby and people can suggest but the final list will come from the Ogunola’s 
1. I suggest diapers 🎀

[6/17/22, 8:03:31 AM] ‪+234 803 410 3239‬: READ THE MESSAGE CAREFULLY!!!

A rich man was once interviewed on an Israeli TV programme. He was a Billionaire.

He was asked if he had ever been surprised by anything. He said Yes, on one of his many trips around the World, a Christian man shocked him with his belief.

So he began to explain:

In the street of Jerusalem one day, I looked directly inside a Church Building and saw a man extending his clenched palms towards Heaven.

It was after the afternoon prayer. Everyone had finished praying and gone to their destinations, but he remained praying.

Curious, I went inside the Church Building to see the man's face and I saw him in tears as he was praying fervently.

I waited patiently until he was done with his prayer. Then I asked him what was his problem?

He said he had an urgent need for $9,000 for his Wife in the Hospital.

I said, "Is that why you are praying so passionately?" He said Yes.

Coincidentally, I had exactly $9,000 in my pocket. So I counted the money and gave it to him.

Without waiting to thank me first, he prostrated instantly to thank GOD. Then he stood up and thanked me too.

Bewildered by his attitude, I told him how impressed I was. So, I extended to him my personal card containing my direct line and direct email address.

"I am impressed by you, anytime you need anything, money...any amount, call me directly and you shall have it."

This man shocked me!!! He refused my offer.

The TV host was surprised too. "Why did he reject your offer?"

"His reason made me a changed Man’” answered the young Billionaire.

"What was his reason?", the obviously impatient TV host asked.

Well, in his words, he said "No, thanks. I won't call you when I need money or anything else. I will always call the ONE who sent you."

Don't let any man play God in your life. GOD is the Giver and Controller of the Universe. Hold onto Him only.
Goodmorning all.

1. Banana
2. Dresser
3. Grammar
4. Potato
5. Revive
6. Uneven
7. Assess

Give it another try....


Look at each word carefully. You'll kick yourself when you discover the answer. This is so cool.....

No, it is not that they all have at least 2 double letters....
[6/23/22, 3:38:15 PM] Prof Tayo Makinde: Answer will come tomorrow morning by God's grace
[6/23/22, 3:48:35 PM] Aunt Joke: I saw it on youtube and I lost hope 
When the pastor that campaign for Tinubu told me Tinubu tried for Lagos, I said no. Tinubu came to Lagos from USA and he would see that all they need to do to solve the traffic problems in Lagos is to make the lanes 7 lanes each on each side like they did for lekki tollgate where he is collecting money and see if that will not solve the problem. That is what they did in the mega cities in USA like Texas and California 
The pastor said they will demolish many houses and I said yes that is unavoidable but then you pay compensation for that. If any country can avoid that,Nigeria can with all that money each of the politicians have that is more that the budget of most countries ☹️

So I really enjoy online and I don’t think I can go to a full church any time soon. Unless it is not more than one hour

[7/10/22, 6:03:00 AM] Prof Tayo Makinde: *NIGERIAN NAIRA IS FAST BECOMING THE WEAKEST CURRENCY IN AFRICA, AS CHOICE OF PRESIDENT OF NIGERIA IS POOR & WEAK ACADEMICALLY & EDUCATIONALLY.*

See and judge your economy👇👇👇👇

South Africa: Rand 1= ₦79 

Angola: 1Kwanza = ₦12 

Botswana: 1Pula = ₦28

Cape Verde: 1Escudo = ₦8

Algeria: 1Dinar = ₦12

Egypt: 1Pound = ₦35

Eritrea: 1Nakata = ₦18

Ethiopia: 1Birr = ₦19

Ghana: 1Cedi = ₦56

Gambia 1 Dalasi = ₦9

Kenya: 1Shilling = ₦6

Liberia: 1Dinar = ₦8

Lesotho: 1Loti = ₦19

Libya: 1Dinar = ₦156

Morocco: 1Dirham = ₦176 

Madagascar: 1Ariary = ₦14

Mauritius: 1Rupee = ₦16 

Malawi: 1Kwacha = ₦21

Mozambique: 1Metical = ₦24

Namibia: 1Dollar = ₦32

Sudan: 1Pound = ₦42

Swaziland: 1Lilangeri = ₦19

Tunisia: 1Dinar = ₦150 

Zambia: 1Kwacha = ₦28

Even the worst economies of Africa now have more valuable Exchange rate than us.
As at today $1 = ₦620
€1 = ₦680
£1 = ₦720

₦1,000,000.00 is less than $2,000.00.....and some think that we have not reached the breakpoint??

Putin (Russia): Lawyer

Biden (America): Lawyer

Merkel (Germany): PhD Physical Chemistry

Xi Jinping (China): Chemical Engineer and Doctor of Law

Ghanian President: Doctorate holder

Buhari (Nigeria): WAEC not found 

Today Nigerians are arguing about another man who doesn't have FSLC, WAEC or  any educational qualifications but wants to lead the whole country as president. Maybe the devil that was cast out of heaven fell directly into Nigeria.
[7/10/22, 10:30:23 AM] Aunt Joke: So sad 😞
[7/10/22, 11:44:58 AM] DAD: Pathetic
May God help us in Jesus name
[7/10/22, 2:07:03 PM] DAD: During the reign of one of the foremost *Akarigbo of Remo kingdom* , three persons came to him dragging a young man with them and said to him, *Alayeluwa* , this man has murdered our father."

*Oba Akarigbo*: "Why did you kill their father?"

*Kobiowu*: "I'm a goatherd. My goat ate from their father's farm and he threw a stone at my goat and it died so I also took the stone and threw it at their father and he also died."

*Alayeluwa Oba Akarigbo*: "Because of this, I pass judgment on your charge of  murder by sentencing you to death."

*Kobiowu* said:
"I ask for 3 days before you execute the judgment. My late father left me some wealth and I have a sister to take care of. If you kill me now, the wealth and my sister will have no guardian."

*Alayeluwa*: "Who will stand for your bail?"

*Kobiowu*  looking into the crowd, pointed at *Abanise*.

*Kabiyesi Akarigbo* : "Do you agree to stand for him, *Abanise*?"

*Abanise* :"Yes."

*Kabiyesi* enquired further: "You agree to stand for someone you don't know and if he doesn't return you'll receive his penalty."

*Abanise*: "I accept."

*Kobiowu* then left but after two days and into the third day there was still no sign of him. 

Everyone was very afraid for *Abanise* who had accepted to receive the penalty of death if the man failed to return.

Just before it was time for dinner,  the *Kobiowu* appeared looking very exhausted and stood before *Alayeluwa Oba Akarigbo*. 

*Kobiowu*: "I have handed the wealth and the welfare of my sister to my uncle and I am back to receive the penalty. You may execute the penalty now."

In great shock and surprise, *Akarigbo* said: "why did you willingly return after having a chance to escape the death penalty?"

*Kobiowu* "I was afraid it will appear that humanity has lost integrity (Proverbs 11.3; 2Corinthians 8:21; Hebrews 13:18) and the ability to fulfill promises (Ecclesiastes 5:4-6; James 5:12; Ephesians 4:24-25) made."

*Akarigbo*  turned and looked at *Abanise* and asked him: "And why did you stand for him?"

*Abanise* responded: "I was afraid it might appear that humanity has lost the will to do good to others (Galatians 6:2; Hebrews 13:16; Romans 12:13)."

These words and events moved the brothers who had wanted justice for their father's death very deeply, and they decided to forgive the young *Kobiowu*. 

In anger, *Akarigbo* asked, "Why?"

They said: "We are afraid it will appear as though forgiveness has lost place in the heart of humanity (Ephesians 4:32; Matthew 6:14; Colossians 3:13; Matthew 18:21-22)."

I have also forwarded this beautiful message to you in fear that 'it might appear that reminders towards doing good have lost place in humanity if I don't'.

I encourage you to also pass it on in the fear that 'it might appear that spreading a good message has lost place in humanity'..
[7/10/22, 2:16:17 PM] Egbon: The Emi Lokan president has chosen someone who has been accused severally of sponsoring Boko haram as his vice in this delicate time in Nigeria. I wish Nigeria well under the control of APC o. We also have to note that this is a Muslim-Muslim ticket, not preaching intolerance for other religion, be we can all see things that have happened even when it was a Muslim-Christian power. May God bless Nigeria and help us take back this country, nobody will help us… God has given us all we need as human beings to fight for ourselves. We need to go out and not only vote but get other to vote for people that have our interest in mind. 
We can’t keep thinking this banditry only happens in the north… they are already among us o, they just need more power to start carrying out their evil works and this is exactly what a win for APC in 2023 means. May God continue to keep us o.
[7/10/22, 2:31:13 PM] DAD: Amen o
No way to same religion ticket
They can not say there is no credible Christian in the North
[7/10/22, 2:38:22 PM] Egbon: I hope the south and Christians come out to vote in the next election and also make sure their votes counts, else we are handing over this country to them on a platter of gold. They have the numbers, vote buying and rigging strategy which is why they have presented a Muslim-Muslim, they know we will just sit at home and be waiting for a Miracle to happen while they will mobilize their Almajiri in the north. Those that will vote in the south too have already been bought by them… so a lot of work has to be done, else…. May God help us post 2023. Nothing is working under the said APC administration, students are on strike, no light, no fuel… $1 is 620 naira and all they care about is holding on to power… If only they can use their so called very good political strategy to make Nigeria better
[7/10/22, 5:20:31 PM] DAD: It is pathetic

 Always drink water even if you don't feel thirsty or need it... the biggest health problems and most of them are from the lack of water in the body. 2 litres Minimum per day (24 hours) 

*Second tip:*
 Play sports even when you are at the top of your preoccupation...the body must be moved, even if only by walking...or swimming...or any kind of sports. 🚶 Walking is Good for a Start... 👌

 *Third Tip:*
Reduce food...

 Leave excessive food cravings... because it never brings good. Don't deprive yourself, but reduce the quantities. Use more Of Protein,  Carbohydrates based Foods.

 *Fourth tip*

*Sixth tip*
 As it is said..leave your Money in the Sun.. and sit in the Shade.. don't limit yourself and those around you... money was made to live By it, not to live For it.

*Seventh tip*
 Don't make yourself feel Sorry for anyone, nor on something you could not Achieve,
  Nor anything that you could not Own.
 Ignore it, Forget it;

Heart Attacks- - -
Drinking Warm
Water:

This is a very good article. Not only about the warm water after your meal,
but about Heart Attack's . The Chinese and Japanese drink hot tea with their
meals, not cold water, maybe it is time we adopt
their drinking habit while
eating. For those who like to drink cold water, this
article is applicable to
you. It is very Harmful to have Cold Drink/Water during a meal. Because,
the cold water will solidify the oily stuff that you
have just consumed. It will
slow down the digestion. Once this 'sludge'
reacts with the acid, it will break down and be
absorbed by the intestine faster than the solid food. It will line the intestine. Very soon, this will turn into fats
and lead to cancer . It is best to drink hot soup
or warm water after a meal.

French fries and Burgers
are the biggest enemy of heart health. A coke after that gives more power to
this demon. Avoid them for
your Heart's & Health.

Drink one glass of warm water just when you are about to go to bed to avoid clotting of the blood at night to avoid heart attacks or strokes. 

A cardiologist says if everyone who reads this
message sends it to 10 people, you can be sure that we'll save at least
one life. ... 

So, please be a true friend and send this article to people you care about.

Must read 👆👌

Cheers And Enjoy life Know your genotype before you say yes to that handsome guy or to that beautiful lady whom you wish to spend the rest of your life with...

07060714545 telling me he was doing some
registration online and he mistakenly put my
number on what he was registering, that my
number is similar to his number and that the
password of what he was registering was sent
to my phone which I actually saw as 6310.
He was now appealing to me to give him the
reset code that was sent to my phone so that
he could finish his registration. I told him to
call me with the number he claimed was
similar to mine so that I could verify his
claim, he told me he didn't have credit in that
line.
I got online to find out more, only to discover
he was actually trying to reset my bank
online/yahoomail password and that he is a
fraudster, an account hacker and also a 419er.
If I had given him the code which was sent to
my phone, he would have used it to reset my
bank online/mobile app account.
Please let us be careful and vigilant.
Fraudsters are devising new ways every day.
This is a new way of defrauding people...
Share to prevent others from being defrauded.

I was called and the caller claimed to be calling from MTN Office,

So I Opt-in to hear from,

I was asked how long I have been using my sim... I told them about 15years, which was the truth,

I was asked if I have received the MTN bonuses being shared to those category of people, 

I answered no,

He asked if am on MTN WhatsApp group, I answered no,

Then he said that's why I haven't received it,

He said he will add me to the group, that mtn will send me a code now, which will be used to add me on their system, 

They requested for me to tell them the code,

Truly the code was sent to my line and i called same to them, 

A minute after the call,

I began to receive debit alert from my bank, #50,000, 30,000, 20,000,

That was how they drain all the money in my account, Total of #510,000, 

I complained to my bank afterwards, I was told it's from fraudster and they use any means, 

Sometimes they even say they are from DStv/Gotv,

Avoid pretending that you are still young.   Always remember that time does not wait for anybody. Think twice about your age. As the days go by, we approach our resting place.  Ask yourself this question.

What have I really done for my family, relatives, friends and God since I came to this earth?

Is there anything I can still do? 

So do something now because time is passing swiftly and it may be too late. Every day you get older, make yourself a treasure because this world is temporary.

[8/9/22, 7:07:37 AM] Mom Airtel: *A LESSON FOR ALL*

One morning at our Law College, when our new teacher for "Introduction to Rights" entered the classroom, the first thing he did was to ask the name of a student who was seated on the first bench: 

‘’What is your name?"

"My name is Juan, Sir."

"Leave the classroom and I don't want to ever see you in my class ever!" screamed the unpleasant teacher.

Juan was bewildered. 

When he got hold of his senses, he got up quickly, collected his belongings and left the classroom.

All were scared and angry; however nobody spoke anything.

"Well, let's start the class," said the new teacher. 

"What purpose do the enacted laws serve?"

We were afraid, but slowly gained confidence and we began to answer his questions.

"So that there is order in our society."

"No!" the teacher shouted.

"So that people pay for their wrong actions?"

"No! Doesn't anybody here have enough brains to know the answer to this question?!" asked the teacher, sarcastically.

"So that there is justice," said a girl timidly.

"At last! One person who is not a complete moron! That's correct.... so that there is justice. 

And now, what is the use of justice?"

All of us were extremely uneasy with his rude attitude. 

However, we continued trying to answer....
"To safeguard human rights."

"Well, what more?" asked the teacher.

"To differentiate right from wrong and to reward the good."

"Ok, that's not bad. 

However, answer this question: 

Did I act correctly when expelling Juan from the classroom?"

All were quiet, nobody answered.

"I want a decisive and unanimous answer!" he shouted.

"No!" we all replied in unison.

"Then could you say I committed an injustice?"

"Yes!"

Then his voice softened and he asked, "And why did nobody do anything in that respect? 

So why do we need rules and laws if we don't have the necessary will to practice them? 

Each one of you has an obligation to do something when you witness an injustice. 

ALL of you! 

Do not stay quiet, never again! 

Go and call Juan," he said staring at me.

On that day, I received the most practical lesson in my course of Law. 

When we don't defend our rights, we lose our dignity, and dignity is not negotiable

NB. “Don’t just sit down and watch things go bad under your nose. 

Say Something and do something. It doesn't matter if you are called names or you face not being liked.   

We’re all guilty....

Kindly forward this message to all your groups. 

If we see injustice and do nothing that injustice will come one day and haunt us. 

That is the lesson of the failure of Nigeria.

She said she can’t wait to leave the position because students bring gun to class and tell them what to do and if during exam you try to stop them from cheating, they will tell you they will kill you 
So what type of graduate do you think they will produce

[8/31/22, 6:24:56 AM] ‪+234 803 410 3239‬: PLEASE READ

I wanted to get a new SIM to complement the one I already have. Then I decided to patronise a road side sim vendor and the unexpected happened. 

During registration, I gave out the needed details to the vendor and the registration was going on smoothly until it got to capturing.

Usually, you are expected to be captured once but the vendor captured me twice and that made me suspicious. So I queried him but he gave a flimsy excuse.

Immediately after the registration, I got a welcome text message indicating I registered two numbers instead of one and

I asked why two numbers registered in my name instead of one, the vendor said "it's normal, that sometimes the issue is from the network operators”. 

The next day, I went to Glo office to lay a complain and the moment I mentioned what brought me, the manager there said

"these guys again? Why doing these to innocent people"?, that was when I realized the gravity of what just happened. The second number was deregistered, the case was reported and the guy was picked up.

Questioning the vendor, he said they usually use people's details to register other sim cards which they resell to "car trackers" at a higher price. 

On further interrogation, he confessed that he uses people's details to register sim cards which they sell to fraudsters,

ritualists, kidnappers and he makes a lot of money from the business.

Now, imagine if he sold this second number to a kidnapper or a fraudster and when tracked, my picture and details would pop up and it would be difficult to deny.

I'm putting this out here because a lot of innocent people are in prisons today because of cr!me they know nothing about.

While doing your registration, please be attentive and report any suspicion to the right authority.

[9/25/22, 12:45:16 PM] Mom Airtel: 🔴 *A couple came home at midnight after having a good time at a restaurant, only to find the smell of gas around the house.*
The man went to the kitchen and detected a stronger smell. The subconscious mind pushed him to turn on the light. and the kitchen exploded, the husband died instantly and the wife was moved to intensive care where she still remains.
The furniture was seen 200 metres from the house, which meant that the gas pipe explosion was stronger than a bomb.
*LEARNING* *POINT*: The lesson from this appalling incident is as follows:
When you smell the gas:
1.-- *Do* *not* *turn* *on* *the* *light*. BUT, OPEN ALL THE DOORS AND WINDOWS CALMLY so that no spark occurs, then close the gas tube; 
2. -- *Do* *not* *turn* *on* *the* *light* until the smell of gas completely disappears;
3.-- *Also* *do* *not* *open* *the* *refrigerator* if you smell the gas. Because it also causes an explosion;
4. -- *Even* *the* *fan,* *do* *not* *switch* *it* *on*. Because it has an electrical charge. JUST OPEN THE WINDOWS CALMLY.
*You should not read this alone, publish it as much as you can, perhaps God will help you to avoid danger, and you will be rewarded. Remain blessed...*

[10/6/22, 6:49:42 AM] ‪+234 803 410 3239‬: At the funeral service of late Queen Elizabeth, towards the end of the service, I was touched by the Archbishop's last words before the body was taken to the grave for burial. He said: *Now let us remove all symbols of power from the coffin, so that our sister, Elizabeth can be committed to the grave as a simple Christian*.
And Immediately, the staff of office was removed, then the scepter was also removed, the crown followed and all other valuables were removed. The Queen was buried with *NOTHING*. Notice that the Archbishop did not include *Queen* to her name at this point too.

This goes to reconfirm that life is indeed vanity. It is transient, and that teaches us humility. Humility in power, humility in relating with others, humility in our acquisition of wealth, and humility in all our endeavors, because in the end, we will all go back with NOTHING.

 On this occasion Heartiest Greetings to all the Seniors Citizens, & good wishes for active, healthy life ahead. 
The senior citizens may please note & seriously follow the under-noted cautionary advice. 

*A study in the United States shows  That over 51% of Old people fall down while climbing stairs. 
Every year, many Americans are killed by falling while climbing stairs.*

*Experts Reminder:* 

*After 50 years:- these 10 actions should be avoided:*

*1. Do Not climb the staircase.*
*If must climb, Hold on firmly to Stair-case railings.*💐
 
*2. Do not rapidly twist your head.* 
*Warm up your whole body first.*😇

*3.  Do not bend your body to touch your toe. Warm up your whole body first.*

ANYONE WHO STOPS WALKING, HEALTH ABANDONS HIM, FOR THE SKIN SECRETS LEPTONIC ACID, (LAZINESS HORMONE.)

 《 WHY SHOULD WE WALK? 》

I want everyone to read the answer.

● We walk to fight stress, psychological pressures...

● We walk to reduce our weight,

● We walk to treat diabetes, cholesterol...,

● We walk to activate the functions of the kidneys, liver, eyes...,

● We walk to energize the action of the heart and reduce the hardness of the arteries,

● We walk to avoid colon inflammation and digestive disorders,

● We walk to activate our immune system,

● We walk to activate our muscles, our bones and to strengthen our health.

● Each element above merits walking sessions. Doctors and experts are unanimous that walking is a medicine that cures all these diseases.

● Doctors further confirm that: walking plays a very important role in treating all diseases: organic, mental, psychosomatic..., and if a medicine as effective as walking existed on the market, doctors would prescribe it in all prescriptions.

● Walking is an effective and free remedy, but, alas, patients are still reluctant to use it.

● An eminent doctor made this beautiful statement:
《 If a sports ground were laid out around each hospital and the patients practiced walking there, half of the patients would not be hospitalised there; and half of the patients will leave them definitively. 》

● God created us to walk. But we are nailed to chairs. And when diseases invade us they spread us on white sheets instead of pushing us to walk.

● Let's take action so that our health and well-being remain.

Please pass this information on to the one you love!
Thanks.

Some people will approach you and ask you to assist them to deposit some fund with your account, that they have exceeded their deposit. Do not try it.

CBN is tracking kidnapping fund and illicit funds that are stacked at home.

Do not fall victim to such  gimmick from evil men.

Just an honest advice.
[10/28/22, 1:30:11 PM] Mom Airtel: Don’t ignore!

My name is James. I and my wife Sandra got married 14yrs ago and since then we had no child. As Christians, we still believed God for a baby at the due time. Finally, my wife got pregnant and everything was alright. On the day of delivery, I was driving her to the hospital and suddenly our car collided with an on-coming lorry and we had a fatal accident. My sister narrated it thus:

''We had a call from the police through the identification found on you that you and Sandra were in the hospital. When we came to the hospital, the Doctor asked us to sign some documents so that an operation could be performed on Sandra to bring the baby out. The baby came out alive but Sandra was declared dead while I was in comma with my two legs broken. In the night, a man clothed in white appeared to me and touched my head. From that moment, I started sneezing. After 5mins, I sat up and became a little strong. Then I asked, 'where is my wife'? Then, somebody the next door started sneezing too. That was Sandra. 'She's alive, she's alive', the nurses shouted. Sandra also narrated that the same man clothed in white who touched my head also touched her head. Few days later we were discharged from the hospital. My broken legs have also been restored and I can walk perfectly too.

Today, I, Sandra and our daughter named Miracle are all alive. What was supposed to be our happiest day turned out to be a sorrowful day but we thank God for today. Ladies and gentlemen, God exists and still performs miracles, even the miracle of bringing the dead to live.

Now I decree that:
To everybody who claim this prayer by sharing it to 5 different  groups 
1. Nothing will cut your joy short on the happiest day of your life in Jesus name.
2. I command every dead thing in your life to come back alive in Jesus name.
3. This year, may you receive a miracle that will attract the attention of the world in Jesus mighty name.!!!

[11/3/22, 9:06:26 AM] Aunt Joke: Happy Thursday family 
Welcome to the month of November 
Praying for God’s blessings over us 
This year we are going to Washington and Joyce house in Huntsville to celebrate thanksgiving 
And as usual I tried my outfit yesterday, I couldn’t fit into any of my pants 
Don’t judge me, we have been seeing 60 patients every night instead of 25 because of surge in RSV and flu and I don’t have nurses on the floor anymore so I practically have to beg, bribe and do everything to get people to work 
I’m not buying any pants so I have 21 days to loose some of these thighs and be able to get into my pants
[11/3/22, 2:54:28 PM] ‪+234 803 385 5807‬: 😀😀 You still have time, l hope you will achieve your goal. Why are you adding weight when your work load has increased?
[11/3/22, 2:55:46 PM] Aunt Joke: Be la bi ni 
I eat a lot whenever I’m stressed 😩
[11/3/22, 2:56:16 PM] Joke: Perfect excuse to go shopping 😁
[11/3/22, 2:56:45 PM] Joke: You should never live in lagos then
[11/3/22, 2:57:26 PM] Aunt Joke: I can’t 
All those pants still have tags on them 
I have not worn them before
[11/3/22, 2:57:40 PM] Joke: 😳😳🤣🤣
[11/3/22, 2:58:23 PM] Aunt Joke: That is why I live in America village
[11/4/22, 3:33:33 AM] ‪+234 803 410 3239‬: Yes o,a good excuse to go for shopping.

[11/7/22, 2:36:20 PM] Aunt Joke: You know Tinube also did very good when he was the governor of Lagos 
Before he became governor, area boys will stop us when we go to balogun to buy goods for  doksy to collect money and the roads were so bad but after he came he did the roads and drove the area boys away 
Also he did oshodi, it used to be bad 
It is just that I m tired of politics in general even here in America. It is bad

[11/8/22, 11:22:01 AM] Egbon: My problem with Tinubu is that he is currently executing a state capture in Lagos… I know this because when Ambode was governor he tried to move Lagos IGR collection from one of Tinubu’s shell companies called Alphabeta, I was part of the team working on the project in interswitch and we went live for only one day after which all the channels were turned off. And he has a lot of these companies in every Lagos sector, which he uses to embezzle what belongs to the masses. Tinubu can not be compared to Peter Obi in terms of making money from genuine business… he is a master embezzler that hides behind the guise of helping people to strategic positions so as to achieve his own ultimate goal of owning it all. I keep telling people supporting him based on tribe… how many of his tribesmen has helped except for those he turns to his boys/merchinery. I hope Nigerians can make use of rare opportunity we have now to vote for someone who is willing to work for us and not someone who wants to capture what is left
[11/8/22, 11:30:15 AM] Aunt Joke: I agree with you 100%
The more reason I will not vote in America today because they are thinking of bringing Trump for 2024 
I just give up 😞
I have only voted once in my life which was last year 
I refused to vote when I was in Nigeria 
I remember the election that Abiola  won then I was the only adult in our street at Holy that didn’t vote 
Grandpa was so mad as you all know he did not play with politics but I told him I couldn’t waste my time to vote which was right after all when they nullified the election 
And I’m starting to feel like that about America politics 😞
[11/8/22, 11:38:12 AM] Egbon: But I think we should try to vote especially in Nigeria this time… because the reason they keep rigging themself in is because those who don’t want them in won’t even step out to vote and they know it.
[11/8/22, 11:43:17 AM] Aunt Joke: You are right, I would have voted but 
Alabama does not have any federal election or governor seats unlike Georgia and Pennsylvania those are crucial elections
[11/8/22, 11:49:31 AM] Egbon: Oh Okay ma. It is well
[11/8/22, 12:07:53 PM] Aunt Joke: Family 
Lesson from all of this is that no matter the position you are in have the fear of God 
Tinube changed Lagos state and since then he hold Lagos hostage even though he is rich 
Fam, money is not everything 
Don’t let money cloud your judgment 
I just finished a meeting now about vaccines 
A sales rep want us to change to their brand. I did my research as the vaccine coordinator and I find out that their brand does not give full immunity for pertussis or whooping cough until age 15month whereas the other company gives full immunity at 6months 
I told her no and she went to the doctors and they promised her they will change but I have to approve it 
I had a meeting with the doctors and gave them my findings with proof and they told the rep we can’t change 
She came again today to talk to the chief medical officer and my response is still the same 
Let people around you know if they give you all the money in the world you will still tell the truth.
Money will not last but God’s blessings will last forever 
Shalom

[11/14/22, 1:38:27 PM] Aunt Joke: Let me tell y’all something funny 
I went to the post office today and they are repairing the the exit road so they told me to reverse 
I was so confused and was looking at the man and trying to reverse, the man finally gave up and just lifted up the yellow tape and told to just stop before I hit the tree or other cars 
I said to myself I was about to tell him to come drive the car 
I can drive straight but when it comes to reverse I don’t do it
[11/14/22, 1:40:23 PM] Egbon: 😆😆

Bro Koye is going to St. Louis because Candace has to work on Friday and I can’t drive to Huntsville so I will be celebrating in Montgomery 
Also mother Johnson was admitted to for hairline fracture of the pelvic so the children finally decided to use home health because the children too are getting old 
I will have Nigerian thanksgiving party with egunsi, moinmoin elemimaje and Poundo yam and ogi

*HOW TO RETRIEVE YOUR MONEY AFTER YOUR WRONG TRANSFER*

*Please read carefully and learn.*

*Many people don't always know what to do, so today I am sharing with you things you should do when you realize a page you paid for a service or goods is ghosting you:*

*1. Write out the Full name and account number of the page or person.*

*2. Go to the last notification your bank sent you after you made the payment (via mobile app or text) copy out the "TRANSACTION ID NUMBER".*

*3. Go to any branch of the scam artist's bank (the bank you transferred to), ask to see the CUSTOMER SERVICE in charge of FRAUD.*

*While you are there, send an email to SCAMMER'S* *BANK or the d bank you wrongly paid to and copy CBN FRAUD DESK* *(anticorruptionunit@cbn.gov.ng)* *and also cpd* *@cbn* *gov.ng*
& *contactcbn@cbn.gov.ng, this will ginger the bank to take it up fast.*

*What should you expect from this?*
*The culprit/suspects account will be PLACED ON HOLD. His/her BVN will be blocked permanently. No account will ever be opened neither will he/she be able to transact banking business in that name until he clears himself/herself with the bank.*

*Meaning, he/she cannot transfer or withdraw until they visit the bank, and when they do, the bank will contact the police and the suspect when proven guilty will sign a waiver allowing the bank to refund your money.*

*Endeavour to Share with Friends and Family because you never can tell who it might help.*
